He's lost his fellowship position for the fall semester, can find work only in what he considers to be intellectual cesspits&#8212;schools that would brand the young history professor as forever unsuitable for the Ivy League&#8212;and he's one thesis short of a PhD. Rather than doom his career, he takes a temporary job in Los Angeles, a city whose superficial charms signal an adventure. He is ready to make the best of his year out west. The only thing holding him back is his wife. Katherine is a New Englander through and through, and as soon as she steps into the LA smog, she knows this transition will be a struggle.

It tells the story of Marian Forrester and her husband, Captain Daniel Forrester who live in the Western town of Sweet Water, along the Transcontinental Railroad. Plot summaryThe novel is written in the third person, but is mostly written from the perspective of Niel Herbert, a young man who grows up in Sweet Water and witnesses the decline of Mrs. Forrester, for whom he feels very deeply, and also of the West itself from the idealized age of noble pioneers to the age of capitalist exploitation. The novel was adapted very loosely into a film in 1934 by Gene Markey, and starred Barbara Stanwyck as Marian Forrester. The film did not live up to the novel's reputation and is generally regarded as mediocre.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd7eb48685135a207ace.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.67,"goodreads_ratings":4047,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e347b486852b17dc3c18","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c19","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1a","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1b","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1c","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1d","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1e","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c1f","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c20","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c21","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c22","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c23","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c24","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c25","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c26","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c27","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c28","5c29e347b486852b17dc3c29"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"薇拉凯瑟","zh_bookname":"迷失的女人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.67],"goodreads_ratings":[4047],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["迷失的女人"],"author":["Willa Cather"],"zh_author":["薇拉凯瑟"],"bookname":["A Lost Lady"]}}

The setting is a nameless Central European city where Ryder, a renowned pianist, has come to give the most important performance of his life. Instead, he finds himself diverted on a series of cryptic and infuriating errands that nevertheless provide him with vital clues to his own past. In The Unconsoled Ishiguro creates a work that is itself a virtuoso performance, strange, haunting, and resonant with humanity and wit. \"A work of great interest and originality.... Ishiguro has mapped out an aesthetic territory that is all his own...frankly fantastic [and] fiercer and funnier than before.\"- The New Yorker Kazuo Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1954 and moved to Britain at the age of five. He is the author of five novels, including The Remains of the Day , an international bestseller that won the Booker Prize and was adapted into an award-winning film. Ishiguro's work has been translated into twenty-eight languages. In 1995, he received an Order of the British Empire for service to literature, and in 1998 was named a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. He lives in London with his wife and daughter.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics : New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Edith Wharton s dark view of society, the somber economics of marriage, and the powerlessness of the unwedded woman in the 1870s emerge dramatically in the tragic novel The House of Mirth . Faced with an array of wealthy suitors, New York socialite Lily Bart falls in love with lawyer Lawrence Selden, whose lack of money spoils their chances for happiness together. Dubious business deals and accusations of liaisons with a married man diminish Lily s social status, and as she makes one bad choice after another, she learns how venal and brutally unforgiving the upper crust of New York can be. One of America s finest novels of manners, The House of Mirth is a beautifully written and ultimately tragic account of the human capacity for cruelty. Jeffrey Meyers , a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has published forty-three books, including biographies of Ernest Hemingway, Edmund Wilson, Robert Frost, D. H. Lawrence, Joseph Conrad, and George Orwell.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd18b48685135a1dfc6e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"likeNum":1,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Barnes&Noble","segments":["5c29dea5b486852b17da3353","5c29dea5b486852b17da3354","5c29dea5b486852b17da3355","5c29dea5b486852b17da3356","5c29dea5b486852b17da3357","5c29dea5b486852b17da3358","5c29dea5b486852b17da3359","5c29dea5b486852b17da335a","5c29dea5b486852b17da335b","5c29dea5b486852b17da335c","5c29dea5b486852b17da335d","5c29dea5b486852b17da335e","5c29dea5b486852b17da335f","5c29dea5b486852b17da3360","5c29dea5b486852b17da3361","5c29dea5b486852b17da3362","5c29dea5b486852b17da3363","5c29dea5b486852b17da3364","5c29dea5b486852b17da3365","5c29dea5b486852b17da3366","5c29dea5b486852b17da3367","5c29dea5b486852b17da3368","5c29dea5b486852b17da3369","5c29dea5b486852b17da336a","5c29dea5b486852b17da336b","5c29dea5b486852b17da336c","5c29dea5b486852b17da336d","5c29dea5b486852b17da336e","5c29dea5b486852b17da336f","5c29dea5b486852b17da3370","5c29dea5b486852b17da3371"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"伊迪丝 华顿","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"欢乐之屋（巴恩斯与贵族经典系列）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["欢乐之屋（巴恩斯与贵族经典系列）"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝 华顿"],"bookname":["House of Mirth (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)"]}}

Although Frome seems ambitious and intelligent, Zeena holds him back. When her young cousin Mattie comes to stay on their New England farm, Frome falls in love with her. But the social conventions of the day doom their love and their hopes. The story forcefully conveys Wharton's abhorrence of society's unbending standards of loyalty. Written while Wharton lived in France but before her divorce (1913), Ethan Frome became one of the best known and most popular of her works. -- The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd74b48685135a202d3b.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.72,"goodreads_ratings":341,"level":3,"publisher":"Barnes&Noble","segments":["5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6df","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e0","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e1","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e2","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e3","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e4","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e5","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e6","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e7","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e8","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6e9","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6ea","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6eb","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6ec","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6ed","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6ee","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6ef","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6f0","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6f1","5c29e2abb486852b17dbf6f2"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"伊迪丝 华顿","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"伊桑 弗罗姆（Ethan Frome）和精选故事（巴恩斯和贵族经典系列）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.72],"goodreads_ratings":[341],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["伊桑 弗罗姆（Ethan Frome）和精选故事（巴恩斯和贵族经典系列）"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝 华顿"],"bookname":["Ethan Frome & Selected Stories (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)"]}}

Edith Wharton ( born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 - August 11, 1937) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, short story writer, and designer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930. Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight. She was well acquainted with many of her era's other literary and public figures, including Theodore Roosevelt. Wharton was born to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander in New York City. She had two brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. The saying \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families. She had a lifelong friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand of Reef Point in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1885, at 23, she married Edward (Teddy) Robbins Wharton, who was 12 years older. From a well-established Philadelphia family, he was a sportsman and gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. From the late 1880s until 1902, he suffered acute depression, and the couple ceased their extensive travel. At that time his depression manifested as a more serious disorder, after which they lived almost exclusively at The Mount, their estate designed by Edith Wharton. In 1908 her husband's mental state was determined to be incurable. She divorced him in 1913. Around the same time, Edith was overcome with the harsh criticisms leveled by the naturalist writers. Later in 1908 she began an affair with Morton Fullerton, a journalist for The Times, in whom she found an intellectual partner. In addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories. She was also a garden designer, interior designer, and taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first published work, The Decoration of Houses of 1897, co-authored by Ogden Codman. Another is the generously illustrated Italian Villas and Their Gardens of 1904.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddddb48685135a22ad94.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e718b486852b17dded6c","5c29e718b486852b17dded6d","5c29e718b486852b17dded6e","5c29e718b486852b17dded6f","5c29e718b486852b17dded70","5c29e718b486852b17dded71"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"六月的使命"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["六月的使命"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Mission Of June"]}}

In many ways this was her first work of literature. Mrs. Wharton had written Fast and Loose in 1876, it wasn t published until 1938, after she had died. She also had privately published a book of poetry titled Verses in 1878, and published a non-fictional work titled The Decoration of Houses which she co-authored with Ogden Codman in 1897. Thus, while she was no stranger to writing this was an important start to her career as an author of literature. The Greater Inclination consists of 8 works, 7 works of short fiction, and one two-act play. It is a somewhat diverse collection with several stories which touch on aspects of human relationships and interactions, a very dark story which delves into the psyche, and a light and humorous story included as well. In all, it is a very strong first effort and well worth reading. The stories included are: The Muse s Tragedy In this story, the young man Danyers falls for Mrs. Anerton even before he meets her, because he believes that she is the Silvia of which the famous poet Vincent Rendle wrote. He learns what he can of her, and travels to Europe, though far from certain that he will encounter her there. He is fortunate though, and they do meet. For a month they are together at Villa d Este, and they agree to meet again in Venice after six weeks apart. The story finishes with a letter from Mrs. Anerton written after their meeting in Venice, where she explains to Danvers her feelings and the reasons for not returning to Venice after promising to do so. A Journey This is a dark, almost Poe-like story of a woman returning from Colorado to New York City with her dying husband. Through her thoughts, we learn how they grew apart when her husband became sick, and how they travelled to Colorado for his health, but now that the doctors have given up and have allowed him to return to New York to die. It is on the morning of the last day of their travels where she discovers that he has passed away, and her fear of being put off the train with his lifeless body causes her to pretend to others that he is merely very sick. As the day slowly passes, she becomes more and more nervous about being found out. The Pelican - The narrator tells the humorous story of Mrs. Amyot, a woman who decides she must give lectures in order to pay for the expense of raising her son and putting him through school after his father has died when he was just six months of age. Unfortunately, Mrs. Amyot s lectures are about what she wants to say, more than they are about the facts of the subject. As the years pass, the narrator encounters Mrs. Amyot again and again, she always tells him how nervous he makes her, and how she is doing these lectures for her son. She even has the narrator help her in preparing lectures when her popularity has waned, and he helps her find new audiences out west. Many years later, he finds she is still lecturing, still supposedly for the benefit of her son. He attends her lecture one more time, this time with an unusual guest. Souls Belated - Lydia is travelling with the man she loves, Gannett, after having left her husband, Tillotson, and receiving notice that he was divorcing her. They are at first unable to discuss the situation, each seeking refuge elsewhere, he in reading, she in observing others and hoping to not be alone while travelling. Eventually they are able to speak, and they try to setup their new life together. However, they are held back by their circumstances. Though able to live a lie initially, due to others being focused on another couple (the Lintons, who are actually Lord Trevenna and Mrs. Cope) who are in similar circumstances, eventually through a confrontation with Mrs. Cope Lydia learns that her secret can easily be found out. Again she and Gannett search for a solution for how they can be together without being forced to live a lie, or is it better to end their relationship? A Coward - Vibart meets Irene Carstyle s mother whose manner tells him a lot about herself. She seems to resent her husband s decisions which have led to her position, but he learns that the main decision Mr. Carstyle made was very honourable and even heroic. He makes himself a frequent guest of the Carstyle s, more to see Mr. Carstyle than Irene. When an unusual event occurs where Mr. Carstyle attempts to stop what he thinks are runaway horses and is then disappointed when they are not, Vibart learns the story of what happened in Mr. Carstyle s past to make him want to be heroic. The Twilight of the God - This is a short play which opens with Isabel reading and Lucius Warland returning from sailing. Lucius has just learned that he needs to go to Washington and is surprised to find Marion Raynor has gone before he can say goodbye. Marion has left the list of people who are coming to dinner, and Lucius is very excited to learn that John Oberville is on it. Oberville is a man of great power and connections who could get Lucius the position that he wants. He also is a man who was in love with, and who was loved by Isabel, Lucius s wife, and Lucius also learns the reason why they didn t marry even though they both loved each other. A Cup of Cold Water - Woburn intends to marry Miss Talcott and her wealth. He borrows money and then steals it when he loses in the market. He is about $50,000 in debt due to what is essentially theft, and he is about to be found out from an audit; so he decides to leave town. He decides to meet Miss Talcott one last time, but is surprised when he arrives at the ball that those who are there appear so unimportant. He observes her from afar, before giving up the falseness of that life. Later, as he stays in a cheap hotel to avoid spending a night on the ship he is taking to escape, he hears the crying of a woman (Ruby Glenn) and the click of a revolver, which causes him to try to help her when she appears on the verge of committing suicide. In his desire to help her, he forgets his own difficulties for a brief period, and ultimately her story helps him to decide what to do in dealing with his own personal crisis. The Portrait - A group is discussing the pictures of Lillo, and his failure with his portrait of Vard, when Lillo himself is introduced. Later, he leaves with the narrator and discusses the circumstances of his failure, and why it was done on purpose.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de58b48685135a25cb36.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.8,"goodreads_ratings":98,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ecdbb486852b17e06044","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06045","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06046","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06047","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06048","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06049","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604a","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604b","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604c","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604d","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604e","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0604f","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06050"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"更大的倾斜，"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.8],"goodreads_ratings":[98],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["更大的倾斜，"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Greater Inclination,"]}}

It is a chronicle play in six scenes, and an epilogue that revolves around Joan of Arc. It elucidates her immense personality, problems, and potential. As well as the play itself, Shaw also furnishes a number of chapters on Joan of Arc that offer interesting insights into her life and character. This interesting and thought-provoking play will appeal to fans and collectors of Shaw s seminal work, and would make for a great addition to any collection. The chapters of this book include: Joan the Original and Presumptuous , Joan and Socrates , Contrast with Napoleon , Was Joan Innocent or Guilty , Joan s Good Looks , Joan s Social Position , Joan s Voices and Visions , The Evolutionary Appetite , etcetera. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition.

His mother, Jenny, is slowly going crazy from resentment at a husband who refuses either to stay or to stay away.

Because, as he knows only too well, 'after you've been first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate'. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd2cb48685135a1e9c02.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.58,"goodreads_ratings":45665,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dfc0b486852b17dab774","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab775","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab776","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab777","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab778","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab779","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77a","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77b","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77c","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77d","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77e","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab77f","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab780","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab781","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab782","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab783","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab784","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab785","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab786","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab787","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab788","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab789","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78a","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78b","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78c","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78d","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78e","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab78f","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab790","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab791","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab792","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab793","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab794","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab795","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab796","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab797","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab798","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab799","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79a","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79b","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79c","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79d","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79e","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab79f","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a0","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a1","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a2","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a3","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a4","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a5","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a6","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a7","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a8","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7a9","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7aa","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7ab","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7ac","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7ad","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7ae","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7af","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b0","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b1","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b2","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b3","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b4","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b5","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b6","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b7","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b8","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7b9","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7ba","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7bb","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7bc","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7bd","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7be","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7bf","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c0","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c1","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c2","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c3","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c4","5c29dfc0b486852b17dab7c5"],"year":"1960","zh_author":"约翰 厄普代克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"兔子，跑"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.58],"goodreads_ratings":[45665],"year":["1960"],"zh_bookname":["兔子，跑"],"author":["John Updike"],"zh_author":["约翰 厄普代克"],"bookname":["Rabbit, Run"]}}

Many of these poems were written when the author was a young art student in England and a Talk of the Town reporter for The New Yorker , which published over forty of them. They deal with the quiddities of things, the oddities of science, quirks of American life (especially as reported in Life magazine during those smiling Eisenhower years), and moments of epiphany in literature and nature. A number Ex-Basketball Player, Superman, Mirror, Quilt have been frequently reprinted in anthologies. All show a sharp ear, a fond eye, and an active though not always light-hearted fancy. Written mainly to amuse, Updike s early verse was also, as his foreword states, a way of dealing with the universe, an exercise of the Word. Admirers who know him mostly through his fiction should be delighted to encounter what he calls these old evidences of my own high spirits.

This landmark volume brings together Hemingway's most important and timeless writings about the nature of human combat. Passages from his beloved World War I novel, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, about the Spanish Civil War, offer an unparalleled portrayal of the physical and psychological impact of war and its aftermath. Selections from Across the River and into the Trees vividly evoke an emotionally scarred career soldier in the twilight of life as he reflects on the nature of war.

Rich with the uncanny sense of life and action characteristic of his writing -- from his earliest stories (In Our Time) to his last novella (The Old Man and the Sea) -- this compelling novel contains both the warmth of recollection that inspired A Moveable Feast and a rare glimpse of Hemingway's rich and relaxed sense of humor, which enlivens scene after scene. Beginning in the 1930s, Islands in the Stream follows the fortunes of Thomas Hudson from his experiences as a painter on the Gulf Stream island of Bimini, where his loneliness is broken by the vacation visit of his three young sons, to his antisubmarine activities off the coast of Cuba during World War II. The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters -- including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations -- engages in incomparably rich dialogue. A brilliant portrait of the inner life of a complex and endlessly intriguing man, Islands in the Stream is Hemingway at his mature best.

A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. Amazon.com Review The Sun Also Rises first appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: \"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that.\" His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc , Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the \"cool crowd\" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle. Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the \"wonderful nightmare\" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. \"My God! he's a lovely boy,\" she tells Jake. \"And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.\" Whereupon the party disbands. But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style. The Sun Also Rises is Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell. This is a classic that really does live up to its reputation. --David Laskin From Library Journal The publisher is using these two perennial favorites to launch its new Scribner Paperback Fiction line. This edition of Paradise marks the 75th anniversary of the smash 1920 first novel that skyrocketed Fitzgerald to literary stardom at the ripe old age of 23. Several years later, The Sun (1926), Hemingway's own first novel, performed an identical service for him at age 26. The line will eventually include additional titles by these giants as well as works by Edith Wharton, Langston Hughes, and other greats. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.

Gavin Stevens, the wise and forbearing student of crime and of the folk ways of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, plays the major role in these six stories of violence and horror. In each, Stevens sharp insights and ingenious detection uncover the underlying motives. He is the greatest artist the South has produced. Indeed, through his many novels and short stories, Faulkner fights out the moral problem which was repressed after the nineteenth century [yet] for all his concern with the South, Faulkner was actually seeking out the nature of man. Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics. RALPH ELLISON Faulkner, more than most men, was aware of human strength as well of human weakness. He knew that the understanding and the resolution of fear are a large part of the writer s reason for being. JOHN STEINBECK For range of effect, philosophical weight, originality of style, variety of characterization, humor, and tragic intensity, [Faulkner s works] are without equal in our time and country. ROBERT PENN WARREN No man ever put more of his heart and soul into the written word than did William Faulkner. If you want to know all you can about that heart and soul, the fiction where he put it is still right there.

The pageantry and pretentious displays of excess were sufficient to cloy the senses of participants as well as to offend the sensitive. Petronius, a generous and noble Roman, a man of the world much in favor at the court of Nero, is intrigued by a strange tale related by his nephew Marcus Vinitius of his encounter with a mysterious young woman called Ligia with whom Vinitius falls madly in love. Ligia, a captured King's daughter and a one-time hostage of Rome, is now a foster child of a noble Roman household. She is also a Christian. The setting of the narrative was prepared with utmost care. Henryk Sienkiewicz visited the Roman settings many times and was thoroughly educated in the historical background. As an attempt to create the spirit of antiquity, the novel met with unanimous acclaim, which earned the Nobel Prize in literature for the author in 1905. As a vision of ancient Rome and early Christianity it has not yet been surpassed, almost a century later.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd83b48685135a20988f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.14,"goodreads_ratings":22164,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e374b486852b17dc52ea","5c29e374b486852b17dc52eb","5c29e374b486852b17dc52ec","5c29e374b486852b17dc52ed","5c29e374b486852b17dc52ee","5c29e374b486852b17dc52ef","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f0","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f1","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f2","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f3","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f4","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f5","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f6","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f7","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f8","5c29e374b486852b17dc52f9","5c29e374b486852b17dc52fa","5c29e374b486852b17dc52fb","5c29e374b486852b17dc52fc","5c29e374b486852b17dc52fd","5c29e374b486852b17dc52fe","5c29e374b486852b17dc52ff","5c29e374b486852b17dc5300","5c29e374b486852b17dc5301","5c29e374b486852b17dc5302","5c29e374b486852b17dc5303","5c29e374b486852b17dc5304","5c29e374b486852b17dc5305","5c29e374b486852b17dc5306","5c29e374b486852b17dc5307","5c29e374b486852b17dc5308","5c29e374b486852b17dc5309","5c29e374b486852b17dc530a","5c29e374b486852b17dc530b","5c29e374b486852b17dc530c","5c29e374b486852b17dc530d","5c29e374b486852b17dc530e","5c29e374b486852b17dc530f","5c29e374b486852b17dc5310","5c29e374b486852b17dc5311","5c29e374b486852b17dc5312","5c29e374b486852b17dc5313","5c29e374b486852b17dc5314","5c29e374b486852b17dc5315","5c29e374b486852b17dc5316","5c29e374b486852b17dc5317","5c29e374b486852b17dc5318","5c29e374b486852b17dc5319","5c29e374b486852b17dc531a","5c29e374b486852b17dc531b","5c29e374b486852b17dc531c","5c29e374b486852b17dc531d","5c29e374b486852b17dc531e","5c29e374b486852b17dc531f","5c29e374b486852b17dc5320","5c29e374b486852b17dc5321","5c29e374b486852b17dc5322","5c29e374b486852b17dc5323","5c29e374b486852b17dc5324","5c29e374b486852b17dc5325","5c29e374b486852b17dc5326","5c29e374b486852b17dc5327","5c29e374b486852b17dc5328","5c29e374b486852b17dc5329","5c29e374b486852b17dc532a","5c29e374b486852b17dc532b","5c29e374b486852b17dc532c","5c29e374b486852b17dc532d","5c29e374b486852b17dc532e","5c29e374b486852b17dc532f","5c29e374b486852b17dc5330","5c29e374b486852b17dc5331"],"year":"","zh_author":"显克维奇","zh_bookname":"沃迪斯"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.14],"goodreads_ratings":[22164],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["沃迪斯"],"author":["Henryk Sienkiewicz"],"zh_author":["显克维奇"],"bookname":["Quo Vadis,"]}}

In the three decades that Pamuk has devoted to writing fiction, he has also produced scores of witty, moving and provocative essays and articles. Here is a thoughtful compilation of a dazzling novelist s best non-fiction, offering different perspectives on his lifelong obsessions. Pamuk s criticism, autobiographical writing and meditations are presented alongside interviews he has given and selections from his private notebooks. He engages the work of other novelists, including Sterne and Dostoyevsky, Salman Rushdie and Patricia Highsmith, and he discusses his own books and writing process. We learn not just how he writes but how he lives as he recounts his successful struggle to quit smoking and describes his relationship with his daughter. Ordinary events applying for a passport, the death of a relative inspire extraordinary flights of association as the novelist reflects on everything from the child s state of being to divergent attitudes towards art in the East and West. Illustrated with photographs, paintings and the author s own sketches, Other Colors gives us Orhan Pamuk s world through a kaleidoscope whose brilliant, shifting themes and moods together become a radiant and meaningful whole.

In these three tales, superbly translated by Edward Seidensticker, erotic fantasy is underlaid with longing and memories of past loves. In the title story, the protagonist visits a brothel where elderly men spend a chaste but lecherous night with a drugged, unconscious virgin. As he admires the girls beauty, he recalls his past womanizing, and reflects on the relentless course of old age. In One Arm, a young girl removes her right arm and gives it to the narrator to take home for the night; a surreal seduction follows as he tries to allay its fears, caresses it, and even replaces his own right arm with it. The protagonist of Of Birds and Beasts prefers the company of his pet birds and dogs to people, yet for him all living beings are beautiful objects which, though they give him pleasure, he treats with casual cruelty. Beautiful yet chilling, richly poetic yet subtly disturbing, these stories make compelling reading and reaffirm Kawabatas status as a world-class writer.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb6b48685135a221d8b.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.64,"goodreads_ratings":1987,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e632b486852b17dd7a5d","5c29e632b486852b17dd7a5e","5c29e632b486852b17dd7a5f","5c29e632b486852b17dd7a60","5c29e632b486852b17dd7a61"],"year":"","zh_author":"川端康成","zh_bookname":"睡美人之家"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.64],"goodreads_ratings":[1987],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["睡美人之家"],"author":["Yasunari Kawabata"],"zh_author":["川端康成"],"bookname":["The House of the Sleeping Beauties"]}}

Thousand Cranes reflects the tea ceremony's poetic precision with understated, lyrical style and beautiful prose.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de39b48685135a24dae5.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.77,"goodreads_ratings":7024,"level":2,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29eb05b486852b17df96ed","5c29eb05b486852b17df96ee","5c29eb05b486852b17df96ef","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f0","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f1","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f2","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f3","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f4","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f5","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f6","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f7","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f8","5c29eb05b486852b17df96f9","5c29eb05b486852b17df96fa"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"川端康成","zh_bookname":"千鹤"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.77],"goodreads_ratings":[7024],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["千鹤"],"author":["Yasunari Kawabata"],"zh_author":["川端康成"],"bookname":["Thousand Cranes"]}}

The stories featured Emma McChesney: smart, savvy, stylish, divorced mother, and Midwest traveling sales representative for T. A. Buck's Featherloom skirts and petticoats. With one hand on her sample case and the other fending off advances from salesmen, hotel clerks, and other predators, Emma holds on tightly to her reputation: honest, hardworking, and able to outsell the slickest salesman. Like her compact bag of traveling necessities, Emma has her life boiled down to essentials: her work and her seventeen-year-old son, Jock. Her experience has taught her that it's best to stick to roast beef, medium--avoiding both physical and moral indigestion--rather than experiment with fancy sauces and exotic dishes. Yet she never shies away from a challenge, and her sharp instincts and common sense serve her well in dealing with the likes of Ed Meyer, a smooth-talking, piano-playing salesman; Blanche LeHay, prima donna of the Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles; and T.

Buck Jr., the wet-behind-the-ears son of the founder of Featherloom.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd53b48685135a1fa2f8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e1b9b486852b17db8542","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8543","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8544","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8545","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8546","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8547","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8548","5c29e1b9b486852b17db8549","5c29e1b9b486852b17db854a","5c29e1b9b486852b17db854b"],"year":"","zh_author":"埃德纳 菲伯","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"烤牛肉，中等"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["烤牛肉，中等"],"author":["Edna Ferber"],"zh_author":["埃德纳 菲伯"],"bookname":["Roast Beef, Medium"]}}

He was thinking of a young New York, the mighty throbbing city to which he had come long ago as a lad from the New Hampshire mountains. A place of turbulent thoroughfares, of shouting drivers, hurrying crowds, the crack of whips and the clatter of wheels; an uproarious, thrilling town of enterprise, adventure, youth; a city of pulsing energies, the center of a boundless land; a port of commerce with all the world, of stately ships with snowy sails; a fascinating pleasure town, with throngs of eager travelers hurrying from the ferryboats and rolling off in hansom cabs to the huge hotels on Madison Square.

Did you ever meet them? A: I didn t know my aunt at all, or her husband. She died when I was about two or three. She was my grandfather s much older sister--he was the youngest of ten children and she was number two or three. But my mother and her siblings were quite fond of her. As for her husband, they thought he was just an eccentric family uncle, and I don t think they realized how infamous he was in the physics establishment. Q: How much of Margaret and Andrew draw from your aunt and uncle s actual experience and how much is purely fictional? A: There were only a few family stories that revealed personal details about them--for example that she drove an elderly Franklin and had a good sense of humor. My mother had visited her in the nineteen-forties, I think, and she remembered that my aunt loved Oriental art (a trait she shares with my character Margaret Mayfield). But almost everything else about Margaret is made up. I could not seem to get her sense of humor into the novel--the material was just too dark for me. My uncle is more famous, and there were plenty of stories about him--almost all of them revealing him as appallingly egomaniacal and obsessed. There was an article about him in a physics journal which described him, essentially, as the kind of scientist you were not supposed to be. The important thing to remember is that Margaret and Andrew take some of their inspiration from these real people, but the story about them--that is, the plot of the novel--is entirely made up by me. All of the other characters and all of the events of the novel are fictional. For me, the center of the idea was in wondering what it would be like to be married to someone like Andrew, but there was no family evidence to say how my great-aunt felt about it. Just as one example, I had to prune both Margaret s and Andrew s family trees--both had countless brothers and sisters that would overwhelm a 300-page novel. I also had to concoct a fascinating mother for Andrew--but Mrs. Early is a theory on my part, not a portrait of anyone related to Thomas Jefferson Jackson See. While I was working on the novel, I thought of Henry James, and his fear of \"developments\"--that the inspiring material would proliferate and get out of control. I was also interested in the idea of Missouri and St. Louis at the end of the 19th century, after the Civil War and around the time of the World s Fair. St. Louis is a beautiful but strange city. Because of climate and epidemics of disease, in the mid-19th century, it was considered one of the worst places in the U.S. to live, but it was actually very cosmopolitan and self-satisfied, with beautiful architecture and thriving commerce. Right in the center of things for some decades. Q: Did you have to do any research into their lives? Into the science and astronomy that Andrew studies? Or the historical events this novel spans? A: I visited their house in Vallejo and also Mare Island, where the U.S. Navy had a base and a ship-building yard from about 1850 through the Second World War, twice, and I also read about See. His Moon Capture theory was included in a book about the moon that was published a few years ago. He is a presence on the Web, but he is still considered too \"Newtonian\" to be respected for anything. The scandals in Dr. Andrew Early s life are somewhat similar to the scandals in Dr. See s life. The key for me was in trying to see things through his point of view--to make a logic system that made sense to him even though it didn t make sense to anyone else. I think that it is easy for a novelist to understand a conspiracy theorist--the story gets bigger and bigger, and it all just fits together in one s mind. The person creating the story simply cannot understand why it doesn t make sense to others. I think the most telling article for me was a piece See published in the San Francisco Examiner called \"The Ether Exists and I Have Seen It.\" The article was from about 1925, and included six-pointed figures See had drawn. Even to an English major like me, this was absurd. However, I think that if he were still alive, he would insist that he had predicted the discovery of Dark Matter. Q: Andrew has all sorts of paranoid theories but he has a particular obsession with Albert Einstein who he believes is a fraud and also believes has come to California to spy on him (and on America). Why is he so fixated on Einstein? A: I think if someone feels himself to be a great genius, then he is ready to joust with the one whom he considers his most dangerous rival. No one in Andrew s life considers Andrew and Einstein to be on a par--except, of course, for Andrew. He becomes fixated on Einstein because he simply cannot accept Einstein s ideas and can t figure out how to stop them. He sees himself as a Lone Ranger type, preserving the truth from the encroachments of idiocy. There are so many novels and non-fiction works about geniuses who were right in the end. But what if the genius is not right in the end? There are more of those and Andrew is in that camp for certain. Q: You have described this novel as \"A parable of American life.\" What do you mean by that? A: Andrew is a famous man and a genius. His town is proud to have produced him, and he is very conscious of his Americanness--he is the new man from the new world in the new century. And then he isn t. But he never loses that sense of entitlement. Margaret seems to me like many well-meaning Americans who are caught up in the schemes of our more grandiose and overbearing citizens. What are they doing? How should we feel about it? Should we stop them? Can we stop them? If we can t stop them, then what? When the people around you consider themselves visionaries, then you are in part responsible for their actions. That s what I mean by her marriage being a parable of American life. Q: You open the novel with the following quote from Rose Wilder Lane, \"In those days all stories ended with the wedding.\" Why this quote? A: Rose Wilder Lane wrote a book about growing up in 19th century Missouri called Little House series--if not, then she certainly helped write it. She later became a libertarian, and one of the originators of modern Libertarianism. If you look at her picture, she has a plain but interesting face. I used her as the inspiration for the character of Dora and adopted her into the rich side of my St. Louis family, and set her up in a house by Forest Park, and sent her to Europe. I am very fond of Dora, and I think she represents a certain type of liberated woman of her day. The essential question of the book, I think, is \"what does marriage mean?\" In those days, the choices were pretty stark, and so there are several different marriages in the novel. Margaret s sisters are desirable--Beatrice because she has a claim to a large property and Elizabeth because she is young and charming and has good connections. Dora and Margaret are less desirable, and so the one has a subtly arranged marriage, and the other takes advantage of Progressivism to not get married at all. But the previous generation suffers, too--Dora s mother is held in contempt by her husband and Margaret s mother is widowed early and suffers considerable hardship both married and as a widow. So the real theme of the novel is marriage--who do you marry, how is the marriage to be lived through, what does it feel like to, more or less, place a bet and then live with the consequences? Actually, most women s stories begin with the wedding, but that s not the story most novels that Margaret might have been reading addressed. Even now, the novels that continue to be most beloved, like (Photo Mark Bennington) From In her latest novel, after Ten Days in the Hills (2007), the Pulitzer Prize winning author offers a cold-eyed view of the compromises required by marriage while also providing an intimate portrait of life in the Midwest and West during the years 1883 1942. By the time she reaches the age of 27, Margaret Mayfield has known a lot of tragedy in her life. She has lost two brothers, one to an accident, the other to illness, as well as her father, who committed suicide. Her strong-minded mother, Lavinia, knows that her daughter s prospects for marriage are dim and takes every opportunity to encourage Margaret s friendship with eccentric scientist Andrew Early. When the two marry and move to a naval base in San Francisco, Margaret becomes more than Andrew s helpmeet she is also his cook, driver, and typist as well as the captive audience for his rants against Einstein and his own quirky theories about the universe. As Smiley covers in absorbing detail both private and world events a lovely Missouri wedding, the chaos of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the wrenching death of a baby she keeps at the center of the narrative Margaret s growing realization that she has married a madman and her subsequent attempts to deal with her marriage by becoming adept at the neutral smile, the moment of patient silence, before giving in to bitterness. Smiley casts a gimlet eye on the institution of marriage even as she offers a fascinating glimpse of a distant era. --Joanne Wilkinson","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd62b48685135a1ff2c1.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.18,"goodreads_ratings":3258,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4be","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4bf","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c0","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c1","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c2","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c3","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c4","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c5","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c6","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c7","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c8","5c29e23eb486852b17dbc4c9"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"简 斯迈利","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"私生活"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.18],"goodreads_ratings":[3258],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["私生活"],"author":["Jane Smiley"],"zh_author":["简 斯迈利"],"bookname":["Private Life"]}}

The novel originally appeared as a serialisation in McClure's, beginning with the November 1896 edition. In 1900, in his essay \"What We Can Expect of the American Boy,\" Teddy Roosevelt extolled the book and praised Kipling for describing \"in the liveliest way just what a boy should be and do.\" The book's title comes from the ballad \"Mary Ambree,\" which starts, \"When captains courageous, whom death could not daunt.\" Kipling had previously used the same title for an article on businessmen as the new adventurers, published in The Times of 23 November 1892. Plot: Protagonist Harvey Cheyne, Jr., is the son of a wealthy railroad magnate and his wife, in San Diego, California. Washed overboard from a transatlantic steamship and rescued by fishermen off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Harvey can neither persuade them to take him quickly to port, nor convince them of his wealth. Disko Troop, captain of the schooner We're Here, offers him temporary membership in the crew until they return to port, and Harvey later accepts. Through a series of trials and adventures, Harvey, with the help of the captain's son Dan Troop, becomes acclimated to the fishing lifestyle, and even skillful. Eventually, the schooner returns to port and Harvey wires his parents, who immediately hasten to Boston, Massachusetts, and thence to the fishing town of Gloucester to recover him. There, Harvey's mother rewards the seaman Manuel, who initially rescued her son; Harvey's father hires Dan to work on his prestigious tea clipper fleet; and Harvey goes to Stanford to prepare for taking over his father's shipping lines.... Joseph Rudyard Kipling ( 30 December 1865 - 18 January 1936) was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. Kipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888).His poems include \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (1919), \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899), and \"If-\" (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are classics of children's literature; and one critic described his work as exhibiting \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift.\" Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known.\" In 1907, at the age of 42, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date.He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century. George Orwell called him a \"prophet of British imperialism.\" Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: \"[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1eb48685135a1e282a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.88,"goodreads_ratings":17586,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Publishing Group","segments":["5c29deebb486852b17da53b2","5c29deebb486852b17da53b3","5c29deebb486852b17da53b4","5c29deebb486852b17da53b5","5c29deebb486852b17da53b6","5c29deebb486852b17da53b7","5c29deebb486852b17da53b8","5c29deebb486852b17da53b9","5c29deebb486852b17da53ba"],"year":"","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"勇敢的船长（班坦经典）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.88],"goodreads_ratings":[17586],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["勇敢的船长（班坦经典）"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["Captains Courageous (Bantam Classic)"]}}

It was not human, and it certainly was not animal, for it did not belong to this earth as known to man' Rudyard Kipling, celebrated author of The Jungle Book, the Just So Stories and other entertaining fictions, was also a master of the short story in which he was able to combine the strange and unnerving in order to draw the reader into the world of his own dark imaginings. This collection presents the best of these strange tales in which ghosts, monsters and inexplicable happenings abound. From the exotic and magical locale of India, to the leafy suburbs of England and then to the blood-soaked trenches of the First World War, Kipling provides us with a chilling array of experiences and images which will linger long in the memory.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddefb48685135a233e4c.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.63,"goodreads_ratings":118,"level":3,"publisher":"Wordsworth Editions Ltd","segments":["5c29e819b486852b17de5d8e","5c29e819b486852b17de5d8f","5c29e819b486852b17de5d90","5c29e819b486852b17de5d91","5c29e819b486852b17de5d92","5c29e819b486852b17de5d93","5c29e819b486852b17de5d94","5c29e819b486852b17de5d95","5c29e819b486852b17de5d96","5c29e819b486852b17de5d97","5c29e819b486852b17de5d98","5c29e819b486852b17de5d99","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9a","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9b","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9c","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9d","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9e","5c29e819b486852b17de5d9f","5c29e819b486852b17de5da0","5c29e819b486852b17de5da1","5c29e819b486852b17de5da2","5c29e819b486852b17de5da3","5c29e819b486852b17de5da4","5c29e819b486852b17de5da5","5c29e819b486852b17de5da6","5c29e819b486852b17de5da7","5c29e819b486852b17de5da8","5c29e819b486852b17de5da9","5c29e819b486852b17de5daa","5c29e819b486852b17de5dab","5c29e819b486852b17de5dac","5c29e819b486852b17de5dad","5c29e819b486852b17de5dae"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"鲁德亚德 吉卜林","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"奇怪的故事（神秘故事和超自然故事）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.63],"goodreads_ratings":[118],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["奇怪的故事（神秘故事和超自然故事）"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["鲁德亚德 吉卜林"],"bookname":["Strange Tales (Tales of Mystery & The Supernatural)"]}}

The school proved rough going for him at 1st, but led to firm friendships & provided the setting for his schoolboy stories Stalky & Co. published years later. During his time there, he met & fell in love with Florence Garrard, the model for Maisie in his 1st novel, The Light That Failed, initially published in 1890 in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Dick Heldar is a war correspondent & an artist, known for the drawings he sends home to the London papers from wars in exotic places like Sudan. When he returns to London, he attempts to make a career for himself as a serious artist & encounters his childhood sweetheart, Maisie. They fall in love. Then he learns that a minor problem with his eyes is actually the onset of blindness, incurable--the result of a head wound he took during the war. As his vision fails, the light of everything around him--his life, his hopes, his dreams--fail with it. There are trerrible choies to be made between the love of the woman he treasures & the love of the men who stood by him at the front","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de03b48685135a23cac9.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.58,"goodreads_ratings":771,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e92cb486852b17dec534","5c29e92cb486852b17dec535","5c29e92cb486852b17dec536","5c29e92cb486852b17dec537","5c29e92cb486852b17dec538","5c29e92cb486852b17dec539","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53a","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53b","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53c","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53d","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53e","5c29e92cb486852b17dec53f","5c29e92cb486852b17dec540","5c29e92cb486852b17dec541","5c29e92cb486852b17dec542"],"year":"2006","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"失败的光"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.58],"goodreads_ratings":[771],"year":["2006"],"zh_bookname":["失败的光"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["The Light That Failed"]}}

Returning again to the voice of his literary alter ego Nathan Zuckerman, Roth is at the top of his form. His prose is carefully controlled yet always fresh and intellectually subtle as he reconstructs the halcyon days, circa World War II, of Seymour \"the Swede\" Levov, a high school sports hero and all-around Great Guy who wants nothing more than to live in tranquillity. But as the Swede grows older and America crazier, history sweeps his family inexorably into its grip: His own daughter, Merry, commits an unpardonable act of \"protest\" against the Vietnam war that ultimately severs the Swede from any hope of happiness, family, or spiritual coherence. From Library Journal In his latest novel, Roth shows his age. Not that his writing is any less vigorous and supple. But in this autumnal tome, he is definitely in a reflective mood, looking backward. As the book opens, Roth's alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, recalls an innocent time when golden boy Seymour \"the Swede\" Levov was the pride of his Jewish neighborhood. Then, in precise, painful, perfectly rendered detail, he shows how the Swede's life did not turn out as gloriously as expected?how it was, in fact, devastated by a child's violent act. When Merry Levov blew up her quaint little town's post office to protest the Viet Nam war, she didn't just kill passing physician Fred Conlon, she shattered the ties that bound her to her worshipful father. Merry disappears, then eventually reappears as a stick-thin Jain living in sacred povery in Newark, having killed three more people for the cause. Roth doesn't tell the whole story blow by blow but gives us the essentials in luminous, overlapping bits. In the end, the book positively resonates with the anguish of a father who has utterly lost his daughter.

Newly discharged from the Korean War army, reeling from his mother's recent death, freed from old attachments and hungrily seeking others, Gabe Wallach is drawn to Paul Herz, a fellow graduate student in literature, and to Libby, Paul's moody, intense wife. Gabe's desire to be connected to the ordered ''world of feeling'' that he finds in books is first tested vicariously by the anarchy of the Herzes' struggles with responsible adulthood and then by his own eager love affairs.

It is 1830, and the Berrybender family, rich, aristocratic, English, and fiercely out of place, is on its way up the Missouri River to see the American West as it begins to open up. Accompanied by a large and varied collection of retainers, Lord and Lady Berrybender have abandoned their palatial home in England to explore the frontier and to broaden the horizons of their children, who include Tasmin, a budding young woman of grit, beauty, and determination, her vivacious and difficult sister, and her brother. As they journey by rough stages up the Missouri River, they meet with all the dangers, difficulties, temptations, and awesome natural scenery of the untamed West, as well as a cast of characters including Indians, pioneers, mountain men, and explorers, both historical and imaginary, and with as many adventures as Gus and Call faced in Lonesome Dove. At the very core of the book is Tasmin's fast-developing relationship with Jim Snow, frontiersman, ferocious Indian fighter, and part-time preacher (known up and down the Missouri as \"the Sin Killer\"), the strong, handsome, silent Westerner who eventually captures her heart, despite the fact that they are two intensely strong-willed people, from very different backgrounds. Against the immense backdrop of the American West, still almost (but not quite) unspoiled, Larry McMurtry has created a wonderfully engaging family confronting every bigger-than-life personality of the frontier, from the painter George Catlin to Indian chiefs, beaver trappers, mountain men, and European aristocrats and adventurers, as they make their way up the great river, surviving attacks, discomfort, savage weather, and natural disaster. Sin Killer is a great adventure story full of incident, suspense, and excitement, from a buffalo stampede to an Indian raid, coupled with a charmingly unlikely love story between a headstrong and aristocratic young Englishwoman and a stubborn, shy, and very American product of the West, in the person of Jim Snow. At once epic, comic, and as big as the West itself, it is the kind of novel that only Larry McMurtry can write.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd09b48685135a1d9d32.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.64,"goodreads_ratings":3632,"level":3,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster, Inc.","segments":["5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec7f","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec80","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec81","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec82","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec83","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec84","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec85","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec86","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec87","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec88","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec89","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8a","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8b","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8c","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8d","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8e","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec8f","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec90","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec91","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec92","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec93","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec94","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec95","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec96","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec97","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec98","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec99","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9a","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9b","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9c","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9d","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9e","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ec9f","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca0","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca1","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca2","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca3","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca4","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca5","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca6","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca7","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca8","5c29dde0b486852b17d9eca9","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecaa","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecab","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecac","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecad","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecae","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecaf","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb0","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb1","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb2","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb3","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb4","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb5","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb6","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb7","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb8","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecb9","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecba","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecbb","5c29dde0b486852b17d9ecbc"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"Sin Killer（贝利本德叙事）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.64],"goodreads_ratings":[3632],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["Sin Killer（贝利本德叙事）"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["Sin Killer (The Berrybender Narratives)"]}}

The place, St. Louis, Missouri. Charley Floyd, a good-looking, sweet-smiling country boy from Oklahoma, is about to rob his first armored car. Written by Pulitzer Prize winner Larry McMurtry and his writing partner, Diana Ossana, Pretty Boy Floyd traces the wild career of this legendary American folk hero, a young man so charming that it's hard not to like him, even as he's robbing you at gunpoint. From the bank heists and shootings that make him Public Enemy Number One to the women who love him, from the glamour-hungry nation that worships him to the G-men who track Charley down, Pretty Boy Floyd is both a richly comic masterpiece and an American tragedy about the price of fame and the corruption of innocence.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1fb48685135a1e3391.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.63,"goodreads_ratings":1054,"level":2,"publisher":"Simon Schuster","segments":["5c29df07b486852b17da5ee0","5c29df07b486852b17da5ee1","5c29df07b486852b17da5ee2","5c29df07b486852b17da5ee3"],"year":"1994","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"漂亮男孩弗洛依德"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.63],"goodreads_ratings":[1054],"year":["1994"],"zh_bookname":["漂亮男孩弗洛依德"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["PRETTY BOY FLOYD"]}}

A TV writer who's retired to his Texas mansion, Danny spends his days talking to the answering machines of his ex-lovers from New York to Paris and dreaming of the characters in the sitcom he's created. But suddenly, a hurricane called T.R. is storming into his life... In his most moving and richly comic contemporary novel since Texasville, Larry McMurtry returns to the modern West he created so masterfully in The Last Picture Show and Terms of Endearment.

Make that four things. The way of dreams in the mind; the way of tears in the eye; the way of words in the mouth; and the way of my wife Edna Bradshaw when she acts like a cat and love-nibbles me into her arms.'' This is the voice of Desi, the hero of Robert Olen Butler's novel Mr. Spaceman , who has kept a quiet vigil above the Earth for decades while studying the confusing, fascinating, and frustrating primary species of our planet, occasionally venturing to the planet's surface to hear their thoughts and experience their memories using his empathic powers. Now, on December 31, 2000, he prepares for the final phase of his mysterious mission, which begins when he beams a tour bus bound for a Louisiana casino aboard his ship. The twelve passengers will be the last humans whose lives he will experience before he positions his spaceship in full and irrefutable view of the people of Earth, and descend to the planet's surface to proclaim his presence to all of humanity at the turn of the millennium. Poignant, funny, and charming, Mr. Spaceman is filled with unexpected twists and turns, a tribute to the powers of love and understanding and the essence of what it means to be human. Amazon.com Review Desi is a spaceman who has a way with words. Listening to them, that is. He's been hovering over Earth for years, occasionally beaming up earthlings and telepathically auditing their personal histories. At the opening of Robert Olen Butler's metaphysical comedy, the date is December 30, 2000. Desi has beamed up a busload of gamblers bound for a Louisiana casino. His wife, Edna Bradshaw--beamed up earlier from Bovary, Alabama--is making sausage balls, a dish she believes will comfort the astonished visitors. Together, Desi and Edna put everyone so at ease that the abductees quickly become disciples. Butler's narrator is a happy comic creation, a deadpan alien in love with his wife and her fine set of knockers: ''There are three things about this planet which are too wonderful for me. Make that four things. The way of dreams in the mind; the way of tears in the eyes; the way of words in the mouth; and the way of my wife Edna Bradshaw when she acts like a cat and lovenibbles me into her arms.'' In a novel that eludes classification, Butler propels Desi's linguistic struggles, busload of disciples, and attempts to plumb the mystery of human yearning to a tight climax as he plans his first public appearance on Earth, which his new followers believe is a second coming. Mr. Spaceman is by turns a fond satire of science fiction, an ode to the South, and an exploration of marital dynamics that's as besotted with detail as any Anne Tyler novel--though the perspective tilts a little off-center. Edna gives her spaceman a fond pinch on the cheek, and he observes, Her hand lunges forward and grabs a sizeable part of my cheek and squeezes and jiggles it. This physical attack is very distressing to me, especially given the sudden light-heartedness of her demeanor as she does it. This is a side to Edna that shocks me, and the violence goes on. I am bearing it the best I can and now Edna even says, ''Oh you spaceman,'' in that cheery, loving voice that I have grown to recognize in spite of the neutrality of the words themselves. I am very confused and her attack on my cheek ceases and her hand drops and I think I may have missed something. I think she has meant this gesture as a friendly thing. After all, she does not have suckers on her fingers. Butler also frequently digresses into the narrative voices of the earthlings in their monologues about their lives. Alas, so appealing is Desi's narrative voice that these (admittedly often virtuoso) forays into other voices offer a degree of frustration. --Claire Dederer From Publishers Weekly An alien with a heart of gold beams up 12 people on a casino-bound bus on the eve of the millennium in a last-ditch effort to understand humanity before making his long-planned descent to earth in Butler's boundlessly imaginative tale of self-discovery. Desi, who first appeared in the short story ''Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover'' (Tabloid Dreams, 1997), has been hovering over the U.S. (and watching our TV programs) for some 30 years, collecting the words, memories and yearnings of a few chosen people in a great machine on board his spaceship. Although he is the only remaining representative of his species, he is not alone; keeping him company are his curvaceous human wife, Edna Bradshaw, and their cat, Eddie. With the Wonders of Modern Technology at his disposal (Butler uses capricious capitalization throughout the narrative, to convey Mr. Spaceman's voice and delivery), Desi ''interviews'' some of the 12 gamblers, bringing forth their voices via the ''memory machine'' in a series of dramatic monologues that showcase Butler's talent for capturing vernacular and also his gift for parable. Each voice bears witness to a culture-defining event of the 20th century, from the first airplane flight in 1903 to the Branch Davidian debacle at Waco. But before he must make himself known to the world (and in so doing, reveal the ''great and fundamental truth of the cosmos''), Edna prepares an unforgettable Alabama-style Last Supper for her spaceman lover and his 12 guests. Through Desi's alien eyes, Pulitzer Prize-winning Butler makes poignant observations about the power (and inadequacies) of language, the logic of dreams and the universal hope for redemption. He balances the playfulness of alien lore with the weight of religion, marrying the comic and the tragic with mastery. In Butler's view, our stories all have certain inevitable endings. This novel raises fin de siecle literature to new heights and turns inevitability on its head. (Jan.)

This new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky is for the first time based on the authentic original text, reflects the present, deeper level of understanding of the great masterpiece of 20th century Russian literature and conveys its whole artistic richness with all its complexities and subtleties that had escaped the attention of the earlier translators and readers. \"In faithfulness to the original, attention to stylistic details and nuances, lucidity, and brilliance it matches Pevear and Volokhonsky s superb translations of such monumental works of the classics of Russian literature as Tolstoy s War and Peace and Dostoevsky s The Brothers Karamazov . The new edition will have an even more profound effect on our understanding of 20th century Russia that the first appearance of the novel had more than half a century ago.\" Lazar Fleishman, Professor of Russian Literature, Stanford University Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have once again provided an outstanding translation of a major Russian novel. They capture Pasternak s voice with great skill. Thanks to their sensitive rendering, those reading Doctor Zhivago in English can now get a far better sense of Pasternak s style, for they have produced an English text that conveys the nuances (along with the occasional idiosyncrasies) of Pasternak s writing. Notably as well, their version includes some phrases and sentences that inexplicably were omitted by the original translators. The text is accompanied by useful (but not overwhelming) notes in the back that provide information about many historical and cultural references that would otherwise be obscure for those coming to the novel for the first time. Without a doubt, their version will become the standard translation of the novel for years to come. Barry Scherr, Mandel Family Professor of Russian, Dartmouth College Product Description Boris Pasternak s widely acclaimed novel comes gloriously to life in a magnificent new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, the award-winning translators of _War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and to whom, The New York Review of Books_ declared, the English-speaking world is indebted. First published in Italy in 1957 amid international controversy the novel was banned in the Soviet Union until 1988, and Pasternak declined the Nobel Prize a year later under intense pressure from Soviet authorities _Doctor Zhivago_ is the story of the life and loves of a poet-physician during the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Taking his family from Moscow to what he hopes will be shelter in the Ural Mountains, Zhivago finds himself instead embroiled in the battle between the Whites and the Reds. Set against this backdrop of cruelty and strife is Zhivago s love for the tender and beautiful Lara: pursued, found, and lost again, Lara is the very embodiment of the pain and chaos of those cataclysmic times. Stunningly rendered in the spirit of Pasternak s original resurrecting his style, rhythms, voicings, and tone and including an introduction, textual annotations, and a translators note, this edition of Doctor Zhivago is destined to become the definitive English translation of our time.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd20b48685135a1e3c64.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.03,"goodreads_ratings":69821,"level":3,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29df17b486852b17da664f","5c29df17b486852b17da6650","5c29df17b486852b17da6651","5c29df17b486852b17da6652","5c29df17b486852b17da6653","5c29df17b486852b17da6654","5c29df17b486852b17da6655","5c29df17b486852b17da6656","5c29df17b486852b17da6657","5c29df17b486852b17da6658","5c29df17b486852b17da6659","5c29df17b486852b17da665a","5c29df17b486852b17da665b","5c29df17b486852b17da665c","5c29df17b486852b17da665d","5c29df17b486852b17da665e"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"鲍里斯 帕斯捷尔纳克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"Zhivago博士"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.03],"goodreads_ratings":[69821],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["Zhivago博士"],"author":["Boris Pasternak"],"zh_author":["鲍里斯 帕斯捷尔纳克"],"bookname":["Doctor Zhivago"]}}

Pedro chooses young Marito to be his confidant as he slowly goes insane.Interweaving the story of Marito's life with the ever-more-fevered tales of Pedro Camacho, Vargas Llosa's novel is hilarious, mischievous, and masterful, a classic named one of the best books of the year by the New York Times Book Review.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd6b48685135a227bba.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.91,"goodreads_ratings":13417,"level":3,"publisher":"Picador","segments":["5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc78d","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc78e","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc78f","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc790","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc791","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc792","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc793","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc794","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc795","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc796","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc797","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc798","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc799","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79a","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79b","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79c","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79d","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79e","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc79f","5c29e6cfb486852b17ddc7a0"],"year":"1977","zh_author":"马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"朱丽亚姑姑与编剧"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.91],"goodreads_ratings":[13417],"year":["1977"],"zh_bookname":["朱丽亚姑姑与编剧"],"author":["Mario Vargas Llosa"],"zh_author":["马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨"],"bookname":["Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"]}}

The compelling story ranges over the whole of Nat's Life, reaching its inevitable and shattering climax that bloody day in August. The Confessions of Nat Turner is not only a masterpiece of storytelling; is also reveals in unforgettable human terms the agonizing essence of Negro slavery. Through the mind of a slave, Willie Styron has re-created a catastrophic event, and dramatized the intermingled miseries, frustrations--and hopes--which caused this extraordinary black man to rise up out of the early mists of our history and strike down those who held his people in

Yet if everyone knew the murder was going to happen, why did no one intervene to stop it?

As the citizens of an unnamed Caribbean nation creep through the dusty corridors of the presidential palace in search of their tyrannical leader, they cannot comprehend that the frail and withered man laying dead on the floor can be the self-styled General of the Universe. Their egocentric, maniacally violent leader, known for serving up traitors to dinner guests and drowning young children at sea, can surely not die the humiliating death of a mere mortal? Tracing the demands of a man whose egocentric excesses mask the loneliness of isolation and whose lies have become so ingrained that they are indistinguishable from truth, Marquez has created a fantastical portrait of despotism that rings with an air of reality.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd71b48685135a2019eb.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.84,"goodreads_ratings":14935,"level":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29e282b486852b17dbe503"],"year":"2014","zh_author":"马奎斯","zh_bookname":"元老之秋"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.84],"goodreads_ratings":[14935],"year":["2014"],"zh_bookname":["元老之秋"],"author":["Gabriel Garcia Marquez"],"zh_author":["马奎斯"],"bookname":["The Autumn of the Patriarch"]}}

This slim volume contains the story of the sad life of an unnamed, only slightly talented Colombian journalist and teacher, never married, never in love, living in the crumbling family manse. He calls Rosa Cabarcas, madame of the city's most successful brothel, to seek her assistance. Rosa tells him his wish is impossible-and then calls right back to say that she has found the perfect girl. The protagonist says of himself: \"I have never gone to bed with a woman I didn't pay by the time I was fifty there were 514 women with whom I had been at least once My public life, on the other hand, was lacking in interest: both parents dead, a bachelor without a future, a mediocre journalist and a favorite of caricaturists because of my exemplary ugliness.\" The girl is 14 and works all day in a factory attaching buttons in order to provide for her family. Rosa gives her a combination of bromide and valerian to drink to calm her nerves, and when the prospective lover arrives, she is sound asleep. Now the story really begins. The nonagenarian is not a sex-starved adventurer; he is a tender voyeur. Throughout his 90th year, he continues to meet the girl and watch her sleep. He says, \"This was something new for me. I was ignorant of the arts of seduction and had always chosen my brides for a night at random, more for their price than their charms, and we had made love without love, half-dressed most of the time and always in the dark, so we could imagine ourselves as better than we were That night I discovered the improbably pleasure of contemplating the body of a sleeping woman without the urgencies of desire or the obstacles of modesty.\" M rquez's style never falters throughout this recounting of his life and his exploration of love, found at an unexpected time and place. The erstwhile lover is still capable of being surprised-and fulfilled. After an absence of ten years, it is a treat to have another parable from the master. From Publishers Weekly Garc a M rquez's slim, reflective contribution to the romance of the brothel, his first book-length fiction in a decade, is narrated by perhaps the greatest connoisseur ever of girls for hire. After a lifetime spent in the arms of prostitutes (514 when he loses count at age 50), the unnamed journalist protagonist decides that his gift to himself on his 90th birthday will be a night with an adolescent virgin. But age, followed by the unexpected blossoming of love, disrupts his plans, and he finds himself wooing the allotted 14-year-old in silence for a year, sitting beside her as she sleeps and contemplating a life idly spent. Flashes of Garc a M rquez's brilliant imagery-the sleeping girl is \"drenched in phosphorescent perspiration\"-illuminate the novella, and there are striking insights into the euphoria that is the flip side of the fear of death. The narrator's wit and charm, however, are not enough to counterbalance the monotony of his aimlessness. Though enough grace notes are struck to produce echoes of eloquence, this flatness keeps the memories as melancholy as the women themselves. 250,000 first printing.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddaeb48685135a21e0df.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.59,"goodreads_ratings":55582,"level":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29e5c5b486852b17dd46f8","5c29e5c5b486852b17dd46f9","5c29e5c5b486852b17dd46fa","5c29e5c5b486852b17dd46fb","5c29e5c5b486852b17dd46fc"],"year":"2014","zh_author":"马奎斯","zh_bookname":"昔年种柳"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.59],"goodreads_ratings":[55582],"year":["2014"],"zh_bookname":["昔年种柳"],"author":["Gabriel Garcia Marquez"],"zh_author":["马奎斯"],"bookname":["Memories of My Melancholy Whores"]}}

Thanks in part to a simplistic writing style and calm, almost detached third-person point-of-view, Hamsum blends misery and misfortune with tenderness, wisdom, and even humor. Readers come to learn from and identify with the fortitude, principals, and inner strength of these souls throughout their epic tale of early settler life. About the Author Knut Hamsun (1859 1952) was a Norwegian author. He was praised by King Haakon VII of Norway as Norway's soul. In 1920, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for the epic, Growth of the Soil. He insisted that the main object of modern literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the \"whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow\". Hamsun's literary debut was the 1890 psychological novel, Hunger, which some critics consider to have been an inspiration for Franz Kafka's classic short story, A Hunger Artist. Hamsun's reputation was severely tarnished by his vehement advocacy of Nazi Germany both before World War II and after Germany occupied Norway in April, 1940. He lionized leading Nazis and in 1943, in the middle of the war, he mailed his Nobel medal to Joseph Goebbels. Later, he visited Hitler and in a eulogy for the German leader published on May 7, 1945 one day before surrender of the German occupation forces in Norway Hamsun proclaimed, He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations. After the war, due to a finding that Hamsun was in mental decline, efforts to prosecute him for treason were dropped. Nearly 60 years after his death, a recent biographer told a reporter, We can t help loving him, though we have hated him all these years. That s our Hamsun trauma. He s a ghost that won t stay in the grave. In 2009, the Queen of Norway presided over the gala launching of a year-long program of commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the author's birth. On August 4, 2009 a Knut Hamsun Center (Hamsunsenteret) was opened in Presteid, Hamaroy island.","comments":[],"copyright":false,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd0fb48685135a1dc7e2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.24,"goodreads_ratings":5933,"level":2,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Project Gutenberg","segments":["5c29de33b486852b17da0b20","5c29de33b486852b17da0b21","5c29de33b486852b17da0b22","5c29de33b486852b17da0b23","5c29de33b486852b17da0b24","5c29de33b486852b17da0b25","5c29de33b486852b17da0b26","5c29de33b486852b17da0b27","5c29de33b486852b17da0b28","5c29de33b486852b17da0b29","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2a","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2b","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2c","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2d","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2e","5c29de33b486852b17da0b2f","5c29de33b486852b17da0b30","5c29de33b486852b17da0b31","5c29de33b486852b17da0b32","5c29de33b486852b17da0b33","5c29de33b486852b17da0b34","5c29de33b486852b17da0b35","5c29de33b486852b17da0b36","5c29de33b486852b17da0b37","5c29de33b486852b17da0b38","5c29de33b486852b17da0b39","5c29de33b486852b17da0b3a","5c29de33b486852b17da0b3b","5c29de33b486852b17da0b3c","5c29de33b486852b17da0b3d","5c29de33b486852b17da0b3e"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"汉姆生","zh_bookname":"土壤生长"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.24],"goodreads_ratings":[5933],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["土壤生长"],"author":["Knut Hamsun"],"zh_author":["汉姆生"],"bookname":["Growth of the Soil"]}}

This unforgettable paean to youthful love and the bittersweet sorrow of a first heartbreak endures as one of Herman Wouk's most beloved creations.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb3b48685135a220838.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.98,"goodreads_ratings":6581,"level":3,"publisher":"Hachette Digital, Inc.","segments":["5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a6c","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a6d","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a6e","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a6f","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a70","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a71","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a72","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a73","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a74","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a75","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a76","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a77","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a78","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a79","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7a","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7b","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7c","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7d","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7e","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a7f","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a80","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a81","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a82","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a83","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a84","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a85","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a86","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a87","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a88","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a89","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8a","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8b","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8c","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8d","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8e","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a8f","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a90","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a91","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a92","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a93","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a94","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a95","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a96","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a97","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a98","5c29e60fb486852b17dd6a99"],"year":"2013","zh_author":"赫尔曼 沃克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"马乔里晨星"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.98],"goodreads_ratings":[6581],"year":["2013"],"zh_bookname":["马乔里晨星"],"author":["Herman Wouk"],"zh_author":["赫尔曼 沃克"],"bookname":["Marjorie Morningstar"]}}

It's the story of Norman Paperman, a New York City press agent who, facing the onset of middle age, runs away to a Caribbean island to reinvent himself as a hotel keeper. (Hilarity and disaster -- of a sort peculiar to the tropics -- ensue.) It's the novel in which the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of such acclaimed and bestselling novels as The Caine Mutiny and War and Remembrance draws on his own experience (Wouk and his family lived for seven years on an island in the sun) to tell a story at once brilliantly comic and deeply moving. From the Publisher 10 1.5-hour cassettes About the Author Herman Wouk (born May 27, 1915) is an bestselling American author, with a number of notable novels to his credit, including The Caine Mutiny, The Winds of War, and War and Remembrance. He was born in New York City, into a Jewish family that had immigrated from Russia, and received an A.B. from Columbia University. He was first a radio scriptwriter, and worked with Fred Allen, then in 1941 worked for the US government on radio spots selling war bonds. Wouk then joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater, an experience he later characterized as educational; \"I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.\" His first ship was the USS Zane, then he was second-in-command on the Southard. He started his writing career onboard, working on a novel during his off-duty hours. He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons, became a fulltime writer in 1946, and published his debut novel, Aurora Dawn in 1947. In 1952, The Caine Mutiny received the Pulitzer Prize. In 1998, he received the Guardian of Zion Award.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de18b48685135a244e57.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ea01b486852b17df2817","5c29ea01b486852b17df2818","5c29ea01b486852b17df2819","5c29ea01b486852b17df281a","5c29ea01b486852b17df281b","5c29ea01b486852b17df281c","5c29ea01b486852b17df281d","5c29ea01b486852b17df281e","5c29ea01b486852b17df281f","5c29ea01b486852b17df2820","5c29ea01b486852b17df2821","5c29ea01b486852b17df2822","5c29ea01b486852b17df2823","5c29ea01b486852b17df2824","5c29ea01b486852b17df2825","5c29ea01b486852b17df2826","5c29ea01b486852b17df2827"],"year":"1966","zh_author":"赫尔曼 沃克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"不要停止狂欢"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1966"],"zh_bookname":["不要停止狂欢"],"author":["Herman Wouk"],"zh_author":["赫尔曼 沃克"],"bookname":["Don't Stop The Carnival"]}}

Burma is under attack from the Japanese army, and a unit of Chinese soldiers is sent to aid endangered British forces trapped behind enemy lines. China s assistance hinges on a promise: In return, the Allies will supply China with airplanes and military equipment, much needed to protect their own civilian population. But the troops including a young commander named Lao San, whom Buck fans will remember from Dragon Seed are met with ingratitude on both sides. The Burmese deplore any friend of their abusive colonizers, and the prejudiced British soldiers can t bring themselves to treat the Chinese as true allies. As the threat of disaster looms and the stakes grow higher, the relations between the British and Chinese troops become ever more fraught. A trenchant critique of colonialism and wartime betrayal, The Promise is Buck at her evocative best. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S. Buck including rare images from the author s estate.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde2b48685135a22d751.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.98,"goodreads_ratings":307,"level":2,"publisher":"Moyer Bell and its subsidiaries","segments":["5c29e761b486852b17de0d74","5c29e761b486852b17de0d75","5c29e761b486852b17de0d76","5c29e761b486852b17de0d77","5c29e761b486852b17de0d78","5c29e761b486852b17de0d79","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7a","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7b","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7c","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7d","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7e","5c29e761b486852b17de0d7f","5c29e761b486852b17de0d80","5c29e761b486852b17de0d81","5c29e761b486852b17de0d82","5c29e761b486852b17de0d83","5c29e761b486852b17de0d84","5c29e761b486852b17de0d85","5c29e761b486852b17de0d86","5c29e761b486852b17de0d87","5c29e761b486852b17de0d88","5c29e761b486852b17de0d89"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"赛珍珠","zh_bookname":"承诺——中国和缅甸的小说"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.98],"goodreads_ratings":[307],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["承诺——中国和缅甸的小说"],"author":["Pearl S Buck"],"zh_author":["赛珍珠"],"bookname":["The Promise- A Novel of China and Burma"]}}

Buck's acclaimed Good Earth trilogy: the powerful story of three brothers whose greed will bring their family to the brink of ruin Sons begins where The Good Earth ended: Revolution is sweeping through China. Wang Lung is on his deathbed in the house of his fathers, and his three sons stand ready to inherit his hard-won estate. One son has taken the family's wealth for granted and become a landlord; another is a thriving merchant and moneylender; the youngest, an ambitious general, is destined to be a leader in the country. Through all his life's changes, Wang did not anticipate that each son would hunger to sell his beloved land for maximum profit. At once a tribute to early Chinese fiction, a saga of family dissension, and a depiction of the clashes between old and new, Sons is a vivid and compelling masterwork of fiction.

Buck including rare images from the author's estate.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de4bb48685135a255cee.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"Open Road","segments":["5c29ec0ab486852b17e005d7","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005d8","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005d9","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005da","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005db","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005dc","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005dd","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005de","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005df","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e0","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e1","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e2","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e3","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e4","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e5","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e6","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e7","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e8","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005e9","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005ea","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005eb","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005ec","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005ed","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005ee","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005ef","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005f0","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005f1","5c29ec0ab486852b17e005f2"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"赛珍珠","zh_bookname":"儿子"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["儿子"],"author":["Pearl S Buck"],"zh_author":["赛珍珠"],"bookname":["Sons"]}}

For something over forty years Mother had been trying to make him stop smoking, yet every time her back was turned he would sneak out his amber cigarette-holder and puff a cheap cigarette, winking at the shocked crochet tidy on the patent rocker.

Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. This is America a town of a few thousand, in a region of wheat and corn and dairies and little groves. So Sinclair Lewis recipient of the Nobel Prize and rejecter of the Pulitzer prefaces his novel Main Street . Lewis is brutal in his depictions of the self-satisfied inhabitants of small-town America, a place which proves to be merely an assemblage of pretty surfaces, strung together and ultimately empty. Brooke Allen holds a Ph.D. in English literature from Columbia University. She is a book critic whose work has appeared in numerous publications including The Atlantic Monthly, The New Criterion, The New York Times Book Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Hudson Review , and The New Leader . A collection of her essays, Twentieth Century Attitudes , will be published in 2003. Excerpt. Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. From Brooke Allen s Introduction to Main Street Main Street is very, very American, but it is not purely American. Shaw, in his characteristically flippant manner, spoke the truth when he said that Lewis s criticisms applied to other nations as well, but that Americans clung to the idea that they were unique in their faults (_Literary Digest_, December 6, 1930); the British novelist John Galsworthy remarked, truly, that Every country, of course, has its Main Streets (Lewis, From Main Street to Stockholm: Letters of Sinclair Lewis, 1919 1930 ). Still, a disdain for intellect (or for what we nowadays prefer to denigrate as elitism) has been particularly marked in America, perhaps because of our commitment, stated if not practiced, to egalitarian democracy: On Main Street, Lewis writes, to be intellectual or artistic or, in their own word, to be highbrow, is to be priggish and of dubious virtue. More than eighty years after Lewis s novel this is true, and it is true not only on Main Street but on Wall Street as well, and on Park Avenue, and on Pennsylvania Avenue. This is what makes Main Street such a stunning achievement: While it succeeds in being contemporary history, capturing a particular place at a particular moment in time, it also speaks for our own time; it is remarkable how much of Main Street is still pertinent. Gopher Prairie at war is not so very unlike our own flag-waving war on terrorism. Will Kennicott s breezy dismissal of legal procedure Whenever it comes right down to a question of defending Americanism and our constitutional rights, it s justifiable to set aside ordinary procedure can be read on almost any editorial page today. Gopher Prairie s commercial ethos of material progress at the expense of every other variety, an idea Lewis would expand and crystallize in Babbitt , has been refined rather than improved in our own era of no-collar workers who meditate or practice yoga before closing the Big Deal rather than smoking cigars and guzzling alcohol. Lewis, unlike so many of his contemporaries, was never tempted to look for an answer in political dogma: He hated dictatorships and had no particular faith in the virtue or good judgment of the people. All he really believed in was the wavering, imperfect liberal spirit: Even if Com[munism] &amp; Fax[cism] or both cover the world, Liberal[ism] must go on, seeming futile, preserving civilization, he wrote in his notes for It Can t Happen Here (quoted in Lingeman). An atheist with no political illusions, two failed marriages, an unconquerable addiction to alcohol, and a moribund talent might be thought to have had every reason to give up in despair. Lewis, to his undying credit, did not. It is a completely revelatory American tragedy, he said in his Nobel Prize speech, that in our land of freedom, men like [Hamlin] Garland, who first blast the roads to freedom, become themselves the most bound. This has been true of many; it was never true of Lewis. Like Carol Kennicott, he was still reaching though generally failing to grasp right up to the end. His particular type of sociological fiction had gone out of fashion at the time of his death, and he continued to be undervalued for decades afterward. But in recent years we have returned to an appreciation for what he accomplished artistically. For what he was able to tell us about American life, in his day and in ours, we can only be grateful.","comments":[],"copyright":false,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de08b48685135a23f0c2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.76,"goodreads_ratings":21650,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e971b486852b17dee422","5c29e971b486852b17dee423","5c29e971b486852b17dee424","5c29e971b486852b17dee425","5c29e971b486852b17dee426","5c29e971b486852b17dee427","5c29e971b486852b17dee428","5c29e971b486852b17dee429","5c29e971b486852b17dee42a","5c29e971b486852b17dee42b","5c29e971b486852b17dee42c","5c29e971b486852b17dee42d","5c29e971b486852b17dee42e","5c29e971b486852b17dee42f","5c29e971b486852b17dee430","5c29e971b486852b17dee431","5c29e971b486852b17dee432","5c29e971b486852b17dee433","5c29e971b486852b17dee434","5c29e971b486852b17dee435","5c29e971b486852b17dee436","5c29e971b486852b17dee437","5c29e971b486852b17dee438","5c29e971b486852b17dee439","5c29e971b486852b17dee43a","5c29e971b486852b17dee43b","5c29e971b486852b17dee43c","5c29e971b486852b17dee43d","5c29e971b486852b17dee43e","5c29e971b486852b17dee43f","5c29e971b486852b17dee440","5c29e971b486852b17dee441","5c29e971b486852b17dee442","5c29e971b486852b17dee443","5c29e971b486852b17dee444","5c29e971b486852b17dee445","5c29e971b486852b17dee446","5c29e971b486852b17dee447","5c29e971b486852b17dee448"],"year":"1919","zh_author":"辛克莱刘易斯","zh_bookname":"大街"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.76],"goodreads_ratings":[21650],"year":["1919"],"zh_bookname":["大街"],"author":["Sinclair Lewis"],"zh_author":["辛克莱刘易斯"],"bookname":["Main Street"]}}

The time is 1942, World War II is at its height, and the Africa Campaign is raging along the northern coast of Egypt. Against this backdrop, Mahfouz s novel tells the story of the Akifs, a middle-class family that has taken refuge in Cairo s colorful and bustling Khan al-Khalili neighborhood. Believing that the German forces will never bomb such a famously religious part of the city, they leave their more elegant neighborhood and seek safety among the crowded alleyways, busy caf s, and ancient mosques of the Khan. Through the eyes of Ahmad, the eldest Akif son, Mahfouz presents a richly textured vision of the Khan, and of a crisis that pits history against modernity and faith against secularism. Fans of Midaq Alley and The Cairo Trilogy will not want to miss this engaging and sensitive portrayal of a family at the crossroads of the old world and the new. Translated from the Arabic by Roger Allen Review Mahfouz is a storyteller of the first order in any idiom. Vanity Fair About the Author Naguib Mahfouz was one of the most prominent writers of Arabic fiction in the twentieth century. He was born in 1911 in Cairo and began writing at the age of seventeen. His first novel was published in 1939. Throughout his career, he wrote nearly forty novel-length works and hundreds of short stories. In 1988 Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in 2006.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd0db48685135a1db773.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.89,"goodreads_ratings":3768,"level":3,"publisher":"Anchor","segments":["5c29de10b486852b17d9fe56","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe57","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe58","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe59","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5a","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5b","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5c","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5d","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5e","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe5f","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe60","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe61","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe62","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe63","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe64","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe65","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe66","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe67","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe68","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe69","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6a","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6b","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6c","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6d","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6e","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe6f","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe70","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe71","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe72","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe73","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe74","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe75","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe76","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe77","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe78","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe79","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7a","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7b","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7c","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7d","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7e","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe7f","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe80","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe81","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe82","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe83","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe84","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe85","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe86","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe87","5c29de10b486852b17d9fe88"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"哈利利市集"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.89],"goodreads_ratings":[3768],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["哈利利市集"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["Khan Al-Khalili"]}}

A tyrant at home, Ahmad forces his gentle, oppressed wife and two daughters to live cloistered lives behind the house's latticed windows, while his three very different sons live in fear of his harsh will. **","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddbbb48685135a223fd3.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.15,"goodreads_ratings":11633,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e65eb486852b17dd9230","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9231","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9232","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9233","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9234","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9235","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9236","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9237","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9238","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9239","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9244","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924f","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9258","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9259","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925a","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925b","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925c","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925d","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925e","5c29e65eb486852b17dd925f","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9260","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9261","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9262","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9263","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9264","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9265","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9266","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9267","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9268","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9269","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926a","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926b","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926c","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926d","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926e","5c29e65eb486852b17dd926f","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9270","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9271","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9272","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9273","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9274","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9275","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9276","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9277","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9278","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9279","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927a","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927b","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927c","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927d","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927e","5c29e65eb486852b17dd927f","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9280","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9281","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9282","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9283","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9284","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9285","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9286","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9287","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9288","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9289","5c29e65eb486852b17dd928a","5c29e65fb486852b17dd928b","5c29e65fb486852b17dd928c","5c29e65fb486852b17dd928d","5c29e65fb486852b17dd928e","5c29e65fb486852b17dd928f","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9290","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9291","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9292","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9293","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9294","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9295","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9296","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9297","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9298","5c29e65fb486852b17dd9299","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929a","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929b","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929c","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929d","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929e","5c29e65fb486852b17dd929f","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a0","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a1","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a2","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a3","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a4","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a5","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a6","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a7","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a8","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92a9","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92aa","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92ab","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92ac","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92ad","5c29e65fb486852b17dd92ae","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923a","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923b","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923c","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923d","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923e","5c29e65eb486852b17dd923f","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9240","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9241","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9242","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9243","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9245","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9246","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9247","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9248","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9249","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924a","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924b","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924c","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924d","5c29e65eb486852b17dd924e","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9250","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9251","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9252","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9253","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9254","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9255","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9256","5c29e65eb486852b17dd9257"],"year":"1990","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"宫廷步道"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.15],"goodreads_ratings":[11633],"year":["1990"],"zh_bookname":["宫廷步道"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["Palace Walk"]}}

Cairo of the 1930s is a place of vast social and economic inequities. It is also a time of change, when the universities have just opened to women and heady new philosophies imported from Europe are stirring up debates among the young. Mahgub is a fiercely proud student who is determined to keep both his poverty and his lack of principles secret from his idealistic friends. When he finds that there are no jobs for those without connections, out of desperation he agrees to participate in an elaborate deception. But what begins as a mere strategy for survival soon becomes much more for both Mahgub and his partner in crime, an equally desperate young woman named Ihsan.

Rejected by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Today there are almost two million copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages. Now, for the first time, John Kennedy Toole's comic masterpiece is available in a large print edition. Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Walker Percy dubs \"slob extraordinaire, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one.\" Set in New Orleans, A confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presence-Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levi Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones the jivecat in spaceage dark glasses. Included here is the introduction that writer and New Orleans resident Andrei Codrescu composed for the book's twentieth anniversary. Set in oversized type for ease in reading, the large print edition will gratify both first-timers seeking to discover this modern-day classic and longtime afficionados wishing to reread a favorite novel.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd2db48685135a1ea2f2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.89,"goodreads_ratings":199186,"level":3,"publisher":"LSU Press","segments":["5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6a","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6b","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6c","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6d","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6e","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd6f","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd70","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd71","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd72","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd73","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd74","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd75","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd76","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd77","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd78","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd79","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7a","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7b","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7c","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7d","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7e","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd7f","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd80","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd81","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd82","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd83","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd84","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd85","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd86","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd87","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd88","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd89","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8a","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8b","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8c","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8d","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8e","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd8f","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd90","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd91","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd92","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd93","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd94","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd95","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd96","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd97","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd98","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd99","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9a","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9b","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9c","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9d","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9e","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabd9f","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabda0","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabda1","5c29dfd0b486852b17dabda2"],"year":"2004","zh_author":"约翰 肯尼迪 图尔","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"笨伯联盟"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.89],"goodreads_ratings":[199186],"year":["2004"],"zh_bookname":["笨伯联盟"],"author":["John Kennedy Toole"],"zh_author":["约翰 肯尼迪 图尔"],"bookname":["A Confederacy of Dunces"]}}

In the face of centuries-long devastation wrought on the African continent and her Diaspora by slavery, colonialism, Apartheid, and the manifold faces of racism, what form of recompense could possibly suffice? In a voice as eloquent and humane as it is forceful, Soyinka boldly challenges in these pages the notions of simple forgiveness, confession, and absolution as strategies for social healing. Ultimately, he turns to art--poetry, music, painting, etc.--as the one source that can nourish the seed of reconciliation: art is the generous vessel that can hold together the burden of memory and the hope of forgiveness. Based on Soyinka's Stewart-McMillan lectures delivered at the DuBois Institute at Harvard, The Burden of Memory speaks not only to those concerned specifically with African politics, but also to anyone seeking the path to social justice through some of history's most inhospitable terrain.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd09b48685135a1d9b88.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.85,"goodreads_ratings":71,"level":4,"publisher":"Oxford","segments":["5c29ddddb486852b17d9ebf3","5c29ddddb486852b17d9ebf4","5c29ddddb486852b17d9ebf5"],"year":"1999","zh_author":"沃尔索尼卡","zh_bookname":"记忆的负担，宽恕的缪斯"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.85],"goodreads_ratings":[71],"year":["1999"],"zh_bookname":["记忆的负担，宽恕的缪斯"],"author":["Wole Soyinka"],"zh_author":["沃尔索尼卡"],"bookname":["Burden of Memory, Muse of Forgiveness"]}}

He is viewed as one of the first writers of the Edwardian era; challenging in his works some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceeding literature of Victorian England. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920).","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de4eb48685135a257717.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5a","5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5b","5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5c","5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5d","5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5e","5c29ec36b486852b17e01a5f"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 高尔斯华绥","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"小梦想"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["小梦想"],"author":["John Galsworthy"],"zh_author":["约翰 高尔斯华绥"],"bookname":["The Little Dream"]}}

Professor and furniture salesman, doctor, housekeeper, and thief all get it in the neck. The remoreseless quality of the comedy builds one of the most terrifying literary worlds of the century.\"--Salman Rushdie -- Review Novel by Elias Canetti, published in 1935 in German as Die Blendung (\"The Deception\"). The translation into English that was published as Auto-da-Fe (also published as The Tower of Babel) was done in cooperation with Canetti. Originally planned as the first in a series of eight novels examining mad visionaries, the book deals with the dangers inherent in believing that rigid, dissociated intellectualism and detached, dogmatic scholarship can prevail over evil, chaos, and destruction. Set in Vienna and Paris, the novel tells the story of Peter Kien, an internationally respected scholar of Chinese studies who maintains a personal library of 25,000 volumes. After dreaming that the books are burned, Kien marries his housekeeper Therese, believing that she will preserve his beloved library should disaster befall him. Therese throws him out of his book-filled apartment, however, and Kien, now homeless, enters the grotesque underworld of the city. Delusional, he fluctuates between horrifying hallucinations and an unspeakable reality. Kien's disintegration finally leads him to set fire to his precious books and to await his own death in the ensuing inferno. -- __ Product Description Auto-da-F , Elias Canetti's only work of fiction, is a staggering achievement that puts him squarely in the ranks of major European writers such as Robert Musil and Hermann Broch. It is the story of Peter Kien, a scholarly recluse who lives among and for his great library. The destruction of Kien through the instrument of the illiterate, brutish housekeeper he marries constitutes the plot of the book. The best writers of our time have been concerned with the horror of the modern world--one thinks of Kafka, to whom Canetti has often been compared. But Auto-de-F stands as a completely original, unforgettable treatment of the modern predicament.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de09b48685135a23f37e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.06,"goodreads_ratings":3774,"level":3,"publisher":"Macmillan","segments":["5c29e975b486852b17dee5ba","5c29e975b486852b17dee5bb","5c29e975b486852b17dee5bc","5c29e975b486852b17dee5bd","5c29e975b486852b17dee5be","5c29e975b486852b17dee5bf","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c0","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c1","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c2","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c3","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c4","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c5","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c6","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c7","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c8","5c29e975b486852b17dee5c9","5c29e975b486852b17dee5ca","5c29e975b486852b17dee5cb","5c29e975b486852b17dee5cc","5c29e975b486852b17dee5cd","5c29e975b486852b17dee5ce","5c29e975b486852b17dee5cf","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d0","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d1","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d2","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d3","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d4","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d5","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d6","5c29e975b486852b17dee5d7"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"埃利亚斯卡内蒂","zh_bookname":"AutoDaFe"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.06],"goodreads_ratings":[3774],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["AutoDaFe"],"author":["Elias Canetti"],"zh_author":["埃利亚斯卡内蒂"],"bookname":["Auto-da-fe"]}}

It was the most elegant thing he'd ever held. \"That's a mouse cowry,\" the doctor said. \"A lovely find. It has brown spots, and darker stripes at its base, like tiger stripes. You can't see it, can you?\" But he could. He'd never seen anything so clearly in his life.' In this assured, exquisite debut, Anthony Doerr takes readers from the African coast to the suburbs of Ohio, from sideshow pageantry to harsh wilderness survival, conjuring nature in both its beautiful abundance and its crushing power. The blind hero of the title story spends his days roaming the beaches of Kenya, his fingers ploughing through sandy granules of grace and intrigue, his German shepherd at his side. And then there are whale-watchers and fishermen, hunters and mystics, living lives uncompleted or undone, caught, memorably, as they turn toward the reader. A natural storyteller, Doerr explores the human dilemma in all its manifestations: longing, grief, indecision, heartbreak and slow, slow recuperation. Shimmering with elegance and invention, The Shell Collector is an enchanting and imaginative book by a young writer just setting off on what will surely be a hugely compelling literary odyssey.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd06b48685135a1d7f6a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.05,"goodreads_ratings":6869,"level":3,"publisher":"Flamingo","segments":["5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6ce","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6cf","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d0","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d1","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d2","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d3","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d4","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d5","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d6","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d7","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d8","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6d9","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6da","5c29dda7b486852b17d9d6db"],"year":"2003","zh_author":"安东尼 多尔","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"壳收集器"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.05],"goodreads_ratings":[6869],"year":["2003"],"zh_bookname":["壳收集器"],"author":["Anthony Doerr"],"zh_author":["安东尼 多尔"],"bookname":["The Shell Collector"]}}

The novella is a love story of sorts. Herod is a monstrous ruler who derives satisfaction from killing and torturing his perceived enemies. He falls in love with the innocent Mariamne. She agrees to marry him but only because she thinks she may be able to temper his violent urges. She succeeds temporarily, but Herod resorts to his former cruelties when he realizes Mariamne doesn t return his love. His rage at being spurned by the only woman he has ever loved fuels his resentment, and he eventually has her killed. He dies years later, a decrepit old man, alone, despised, and calling out to Mariamne with his last breath. This is an engaging novel, simply told and written in Lagerkvist s style of unadorned language. Lagerkvist s portrayal of Herod is convincing. He is a cruel man consumed with self-importance, an inflated ego, and is paranoid to top it off. When he finds himself passionate about someone other than himself, he demands full reciprocation. His love turns to resentment and then to a seething anger aimed at the woman who deigns to withhold her love. Lagerkvist s portrayal of Mariamne is not so convincing. She is a woman of flawless internal and external beauty, a selfless creature totally devoted to sacrificing herself to save others. She tolerates Herod s indiscretions and his cruelties with an unnerving patience. She goes about living her life as if she is not of this world. In short, Mariamne is barely human. The portrayal of Mariamne reminded me of Virginia Woolf s description of the Angel in the House in her Professions for Women . Woolf describes her encounter with the Angel while writing a review of a male-authored novel: I will describe her as shortly as I can. She was intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish. She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily. If there was chicken, she took the leg; if there was a draught she sat in it in short she was so constituted that she never had a mind or a wish of her own, but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above all I need not say it -she was pure. Her purity was supposed to be her chief beauty her blushes, her great grace. Virginia Woolf comes to the realization she has to kill the Angel in the House if she wants to survive as a writer. Her action is based on self-defense: Had I not killed her, she would have killed me. Mariamne shares the qualities of Woolf s phantom Angel. And it is those very same qualities that cause Herod to act in a murderous rage against her. Perhaps if she had been a little more human, thrown a few tantrums of jealousy here and there, argued with him, revealed she had needs and desires of her own, shown her weaknesses, she may have survived his onslaught.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de3db48685135a24f2a5.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.81,"goodreads_ratings":179,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb33b486852b17dfac62","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac63","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac64","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac65","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac66","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac67","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac68","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac69","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6a","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6b","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6c","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6d","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6e","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac6f","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac70","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac71","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac72","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac73","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac74","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac75","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac76","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac77","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac78","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac79","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7a","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7b","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7c","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7d","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7e","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac7f","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac80","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac81","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac82","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac83","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac84","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac85","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac86","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac87","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac88","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac89","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8a","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8b","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8c","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8d","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8e","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac8f","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac90","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac91","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac92","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac93","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac94","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac95","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac96","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac97","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac98","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac99","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9a","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9b","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9c","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9d","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9e","5c29eb33b486852b17dfac9f","5c29eb33b486852b17dfaca0","5c29eb33b486852b17dfaca1","5c29eb33b486852b17dfaca2","5c29eb33b486852b17dfaca3"],"year":"","zh_author":"拉格奎斯维特","zh_bookname":"希律和玛丽亚姆内"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.81],"goodreads_ratings":[179],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["希律和玛丽亚姆内"],"author":["Par Lagerkvist"],"zh_author":["拉格奎斯维特"],"bookname":["Herod and Mariamne"]}}

In The Marriage Plot , his third novel and first in ten years (following the Pulitzer Prize-winning Middlesex ), Eugenides describes a year or so in the lives of three college seniors at Brown in the early 80s. There is Madeleine, a self-described incurable romantic who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard, a brilliant, temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major from Eugenides own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose, tracing the end of the students college days and continuing into those first, tentative steps toward true adulthood. This is a thoughtful and at times disarming novel about life, love, and discovery, set during a time when so much of life seems filled with deep portent. --Chris Schluep Review Praise for The Marriage Plot : Eugenides's first novel since 2002's Pulitzer Prize winning Middlesex so impressively, ambitiously breaks the mold of its predecessor that it calls for the founding of a new prize to recognize its success both as a novel and as a Jeffrey Eugenides novel. Importantly but unobtrusively set in the early 1980s, this is the tale of Madeleine Hanna, recent Brown University English grad, and her admirer Mitchell Grammaticus, who opts out of Divinity School to walk the earth as an ersatz pilgrim. Madeleine is equally caught up, both with the postmodern vogue (Derrida, Barthes) conflicting with her love of James, Austen, and Salinger and with the brilliant Leonard Bankhead, whom she met in semiotics class and whose fits of manic depression jeopardize his suitability as a marriage prospect. Meanwhile, Mitchell winds up in Calcutta working with Mother Theresa's volunteers, still dreaming of Madeleine. In capturing the heady spirit of youthful intellect on the verge, Eugenides revives the coming-of-age novel for a new generation The book's fidelity to its young heroes and to a superb supporting cast of enigmatic professors, feminist theorists, neo-Victorians, and concerned mothers, and all of their evolving investment in ideas and ideals is such that the central argument of the book is also its solution: the old stories may be best after all, but there are always new ways to complicate them. Publisher s Weekly (starred review) In Eugenides first novel since the Pulitzer Prize winning Middlesex (2002), English major and devotee of classic literature Madeleine Hanna is a senior at Reagan-era Brown University. Only when curiosity gets the best of her does she belly up to Semiotics 211, a bastion of postmodern liberalism, and meet handsome, brilliant, mysterious Leonard Bankhead. Completing a triangle is Madeleine s friend Mitchell, a clear-eyed religious-studies student who believes himself her true intended. Eugenides drama unfolds over the next year or so. His characteristically deliberate, researched realization of place and personality serve him well, and he strikes perfectly tuned chords by referring to works ranging from Barthes Lovers Discourse to Bemelmans Madeline books for children. The remarkably ? propos title refers to the subject of Madeleine s honors thesis, which is the Western novel s doing and undoing, in that, upon the demise, circa 1900, of the marriage plot, the novel didn t mean much anymore, according to Madeleine s professor and, perhaps, Eugenides. With this tightly, immaculately self-contained tale set upon pillars at once imposing and of dollhouse scale, namely, academia ( College wasn t like the real world, Madeleine notes) and the emotions of the youngest of twentysomethings, Eugenides realizes the novel whose dismantling his characters examine. Annie Bostrom, Booklist (starred review) A stunning novel erudite, compassionate and penetrating in its analysis of love relationships. Eugenides focuses primarily on three characters, who all graduate from Brown in 1982. One of the pieces of this triangle is Madeleine Hanna, who finds herself somewhat embarrassed to have emerged from a normal household in New Jersey (though we later find out the normality of her upbringing is only relative). She becomes enamored with Leonard, a brilliant but moody student, in their Semiotics course, one of the texts being, ironically, Roland Barthes A Lover s Discourse , which Madeleine finds disturbingly problematic in helping her figure out her own love relationship. We discover that Leonard had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during his first year at Brown, and his struggle with mood swings throughout the novel is both titanic and tender. The third major player is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major who is also attracted to Madeleine but whose reticence she finds both disturbing and incomprehensible. On graduation day, Leonard has a breakdown and is hospitalized in a mental-health ward, and Madeleine shows her commitment by skipping the festivities and seeking him out. After graduation, Leonard and Madeleine live together when Leonard gets an internship at a biology lab on Cape Cod, and the spring after graduation they marry, when Leonard is able to get his mood swings under temporary control. Meanwhile Mitchell, who takes his major seriously, travels to India seeking a path and briefly finds one when he volunteers to work with the dying in Calcutta. But Mitchell s road to self-discovery eventually returns him to the States and opens another opportunity for love that complicates Madeleine s life. Dazzling work Eugenides continues to show that he is one of the finest of contemporary novelists. Kirkus (starred review) The way of true love never works out, except at the end of an English novel. So says Trollope in Barchester Towers, one of those English novels where the marriage plot thrived until it was swept aside by 20th-century reality. Now Roland Barthes s contention that the lover s discourse is today of an extreme solitude better sums up the situation. Or so English literature besotted Madeleine, 1980s Brown graduating senior, comes to discover. Giving in to the zeitgeist, Madeleine takes a course on semiotics and meets Leonard, who s brilliant, charismatic, and unstable. They ve broken up, which makes moody spiritual seeker Mitchell Grammaticus happy, since he pines for Madeleine. But on graduation day, Madeleine discovers that Leonard is in the hospital in fact, he is a manic depressive with an on-again, off-again relationship with his medications and leaps to his side. So begins the story of their love (but does it work out?), as Mitchell heads to Europe and beyond for his own epiphanies. VERDICT Your standard love triangle? Absolutely not. This extraordinary, liquidly written evocation of love s mad rush and inevitable failures will feed your mind as you rapidly turn the pages. Highly recommended.

In its brevity and piercing simplicity, it may be Mailer s most accessible, direct, and heartfelt work. Praise for The Gospel According to the Son Quietly penetrating . . . [Norman Mailer s] gospel is written in a direct, rather relaxed English that yet has an eerie, neo-Biblical dignity. John Updike, The New Yorker A book of considerable intellectual force . . . The writer s powerful mind works in a specialized way, not by theological argumentation but by telling or retelling a story. The New York Review of Books Challenges readers on the religious right and the atheist left with equally rich interpretive tasks. The Dallas Morning News An informed and believable work of fiction . . . of what may have been going through the mind of Jesus during his epic ministry. San Francisco Chronicle Praise for Norman Mailer [Norman Mailer] loomed over American letters longer and larger than any other writer of his generation. The New York Times A writer of the greatest and most reckless talent. The New Yorker Mailer is indispensable, an American treasure. The Washington Post A devastatingly alive and original creative mind. Life Mailer is fierce, courageous, and reckless and nearly everything he writes has sections of headlong brilliance. The New York Review of Books The largest mind and imagination [in modern] American literature . . . Unlike just about every American writer since Henry James, Mailer has managed to grow and become richer in wisdom with each new book. Chicago Tribune Mailer is a master of his craft. His language carries you through the story like a leaf on a stream.

He was a cultural commentator and critic, expressing his views through his novels, journalism, essays, and frequent media appearances.

From Publishers Weekly Although Tyler ( Breathing Lessons ; Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant ) is again writing about families--the way they cleave together in times of trouble and muddle through with stoic courage--her eminently satisfying new novel breaks her familiar mold, giving us ordinary, not eccentric characters who are shaped by disastrous events into quietly heroic behavior. The Bedloes are cheerful and count their blessings, even if they are far from rich and live on a slightly seedy street in Baltimore. But when 17-year-old Ian rashly informs his older brother Dan that the latter's wife was undoubtedly pregnant before their marriage, Dan commits suicide, and Ian is left with profound guilt--especially since Dan's wife dies soon after. Asking God's forgiveness, he receives spiritual guidance at the endearingly shabby Church of the Second Chance. He drops out of college, becomes a carpenter and helps his parents care for the three orphaned children; as the years pass, that burden falls primarily on Ian's shoulders. Wondering when God will signal that his atonement can end, Ian has an epiphany: ''You could never call it a penance, to have to care for those three.'' Ian eventually does construct a life for himself, in one of Tyler's most appealing endings. The narrative also enjoys her whimsical humor (although the group role of the ''foreigners'' who live in the neighborhood verges on caricature). Since her characters' foibles never overwhelm their homespun simplicity, the reader is emotionally involved and touched as never before. 250,000 first printing; BOMC main selection; first serial to the New Yorker.

Crippled in his right arm and leg, Aaron spent his childhood fending off a sister who wants to manage him. So when he meets Dorothy, a plain, outspoken, self-dependent young woman, she is like a breath of fresh air. Unhesitatingly he marries her, and they have a relatively happy, unremarkable marriage. But when a tree crashes into their house and Dorothy is killed, Aaron feels as though he has been erased forever. Only Dorothy s unexpected appearances from the dead help him to live in the moment and to find some peace. Gradually he discovers, as he works in the family s vanity-publishing business, turning out titles that presume to guide beginners through the trials of life, that maybe for this beginner there is a way of saying goodbye. A beautiful, subtle exploration of loss and recovery, pierced throughout with Anne Tyler s humor, wisdom, and always penetrating look at human foibles. Amazon.com Review Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2012 : \"The strangest thing about my wife s return from the dead was how other people reacted.\" So begins Anne Tyler's new novel, which documents the days of Aaron Woolcott after the unexpected loss of his wife, Dorothy. And as arresting as the first sentence is, it's also a bit worrying. So many clich s could follow. Will Aaron resolve his grief through poetic moonlit walks with the apparition of his lost wife? Thankfully, this is Anne Tyler. And the ghost of Dorothy, like all Tyler's characters, has a kind of rich, eccentric depth that sits opposite to the expected. Aaron's recovery after his wife's death conveys all the subtle hallmarks of Tyler's style, where a flawed man must learn how to do a very difficult thing--say a final goodbye.'' -- Ben Moebius About the Author Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1941 and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is her nineteenth novel; her eleventh, Breathing Lessons , was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3fb48685135a1f1857.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"Knopf","segments":["5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f7b","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f7c","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f7d","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f7e","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f7f","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f80","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f81","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f82","5c29e0c5b486852b17db1f83"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"安妮泰勒","zh_bookname":"初学者的告别"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["初学者的告别"],"author":["Anne Tyler"],"zh_author":["安妮泰勒"],"bookname":["The Beginner's Goodbye"]}}

The woman is Rebecca Davitch, a fifty-three-year-old grandmother. Is she an impostor in her own life? she asks herself. Is it indeed her own life? Or is it someone else s? On the surface, Beck, as she is known to the Davitch clan, is outgoing, joyous, a natural celebrator. Giving parties is, after all, her vocation something she slipped into even before finishing college, when Joe Davitch spotted her at an engagement party in his family s crumbling nineteenth-century Baltimore row house, where giving parties was the family business. What caught his fancy was that she seemed to be having such a wonderful time. Soon this large-spirited older man, a divorc? with three little girls, swept her into his orbit, and before she knew it she was embracing his extended family plus a child of their own, and hosting endless parties in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of The Open Arms. Now, some thirty years later, after presiding over a disastrous family picnic, Rebecca is caught un-awares by the question of who she really is. How she answers it how she tries to recover her girlhood self, that dignified grownup she had once been is the story told in this beguiling, funny, and deeply moving novel. As always with Anne Tyler s novels, once we enter her world it is hard to leave. But in Back When We Were Grownups she so sharpens our perceptions and awakens so many untapped feelings that we come away not only refreshed and delighted, but also infinitely wiser. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd78b48685135a20476a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.51,"goodreads_ratings":15462,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fad","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fae","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0faf","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb0","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb1","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb2","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb3","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb4","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb5","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb6","5c29e2e4b486852b17dc0fb7"],"year":"2001","zh_author":"安妮泰勒","zh_bookname":"昨日当我们盛年"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.51],"goodreads_ratings":[15462],"year":["2001"],"zh_bookname":["昨日当我们盛年"],"author":["Anne Tyler"],"zh_author":["安妮泰勒"],"bookname":["Back When We Were Grownups"]}}

The roster includes such heavyweights as Michael Crichton, Stephen King, Elmore Leonard, Nick Hornby and Harlan Ellison. As the retro title might suggest, the collection is heavy on sci-fi and detective stories, often updated with contemporary twists. Crichton offers a detective yarn called \"Blood Doesn't Come Out,\" in which a disgruntled PI takes out his frustration on his wife in a cheeky spin on the domestic violence that punctuates the pulp fiction of Jim Thompson and James A. Cain. Hornby's contribution is an entertaining sci-fi story called \"Otherwise Pandemonium,\" about a man who buys a VCR that fast-forwards into an apocalyptic future. In Rick Moody's \"The Albertine Notes,\" a debilitating drug called Albertine wreaks havoc by sending users back in time to relive their memories. Dave Eggers's \"Up the Mountain Coming Down Slowly\" is a thoughtful story in which a woman climbs Kilimanjaro to bolster her self-confidence after experiencing a personal crisis, but proves oblivious to the deaths of three porters when the weather on the mountain turns ugly. Half a dozen or so stories are markedly slight, but overall this is a strong collection. Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.

Inspired by their own fears and dreams, Kavalier and Clay create the Escapists, The Monitor, and Luna Moth, inspired by the beautiful Rosa Saks, who will become linked by powerful ties to both men.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62e6c2b48685143660d8cd.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":9,"publisher":"RB Large Print","segments":["5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed1e","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed1f","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed20","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed21","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed22","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed23","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed24","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed25","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed26","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed27","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed28","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed29","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2a","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2b","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2c","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2d","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2e","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed2f","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed30","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed31","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed32","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed33","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed34","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed35","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed36","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed37","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed38","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed39","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3a","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3b","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3c","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3d","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3e","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed3f","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed40","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed41","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed42","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed43","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed44","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed45","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed46","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed47","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed48","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed49","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4a","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4b","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4c","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4d","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4e","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed4f","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed50","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed51","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed52","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed53","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed54","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed55","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed56","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed57","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed58","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed59","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5a","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5b","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5c","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5d","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5e","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed5f","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed60","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed61","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed62","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed63","5c29ef08b486852f6a67ed64"],"year":"2005","zh_author":"米迦勒沙邦","zh_bookname":"卡瓦利埃和克莱的惊人冒险：一部小说"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2005"],"zh_bookname":["卡瓦利埃和克莱的惊人冒险：一部小说"],"author":["Michael Chabon"],"zh_author":["米迦勒沙邦"],"bookname":["The amazing adventures of Kavalier and Clay: a novel"]}}

Michael Shaara's account of the three most important days of the Civil War features deft characterizations of all of the main actors, including Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Buford, and Hancock. The most inspiring figure in the book, however, is Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine regiment of volunteers held the Union's left flank on the second day of the battle. This unit's bravery at Little Round Top helped turned the tide of the war against the rebels. There are also plenty of maps, which convey a complete sense of what happened July 1-3, 1863. Reading about the past is rarely so much fun as on these pages. From Library Journal The late Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (1974) concerns the battle of Gettysburg and was the basis for the 1993 film Gettysburg. The events immediately before and during the battle are seen through the eyes of Confederate Generals Lee, Longstreet, and Armistead and Federal General Buford, Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain, and a host of others. The author's ability to convey the thoughts of men in war as well as their confusion-the so-called \"fog of battle\"-is outstanding. This unabridged version is read clearly by award-winning actor George Hearn, who gives each character a different voice and effectively conveys their personalities; chapters and beginnings and ends of sides are announced. Music from the movie version adds to the drama. All this comes in a beautiful package with a battle map.

The sole tenant in a rundown tenement, Henry Lesser is struggling to finish a novel, but his solitary pursuit of the sublime grows complicated when Willie Spearmint, a black writer ambivalent toward Jews, moves into the building. Henry and Willie are artistic rivals and unwilling neighbors, and their uneasy peace is disturbed by the presence of Willie\\'s white girlfriend Irene and the landlord Levenspiel\\'s attempts to evict both men and demolish the building. This novel\\'s conflict, current then, is perennial now; it reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de5eb48685135a25e02f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.68,"goodreads_ratings":693,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ecfdb486852b17e07032","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07033","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07034","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07035","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07036","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07037","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07038","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07039","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703a","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703b","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703c","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703d","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703e","5c29ecfdb486852b17e0703f","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07040","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07041","5c29ecfdb486852b17e07042"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"伯纳德马拉默德","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"房客"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.68],"goodreads_ratings":[693],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["房客"],"author":["Bernard Malamud"],"zh_author":["伯纳德马拉默德"],"bookname":["The Tenants"]}}

It is a fictional memoir of an aged prophetess at Delphi, the most sacred oracle of ancient Greece, just prior to Greece's domination by the Roman Empire. As a young girl, Arieka is ugly, unconventional, a source of great shame to her uppity parents, who fear they'll never marry her off. But she is saved by Ionides, the High Priest of the Delphic temple, who detects something of a seer (and a friend) in her and whisks her off to the shrine to become the Pythia - the earthly voice of the god Apollo. Arieka has now spent a lifetime at the mercy of a god, a priest, and her devotees, and has witnessed firsthand the decay of Delphi's fortunes and its influence in the world. Her reflections on the mysteries of the oracle, which her own weird gifts embody, are matched by her feminine insight into the human frailties of the High Priest himself, a true Athenian with a wicked sense of humor, whose intriguing against the Romans brings about humiliation and disaster. This extraordinary short novel, left in draft at the author's death in 1993, is a psychological and historical triumph. Golding has created a vivid and comic picture of ancient Greek society as well as an absolutely convincing portrait of a woman's experience, something rare in the Golding oeuvre. Arieka the Pythia is one of his finest creations. Left in draft at the author's death in 1993, this extraordinary short novel is a psychological and historical triumph. An aged prophetess at Delphi, the most sacred oracle in ancient Greece, looks back over her strange life as the Pythia, the voice of the god Apollo.

At first, the stranded boys cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain signal fires. Overseeing their efforts are Ralph, \"the boy with fair hair,\" and Piggy, Ralph's chubby, wisdom-dispensing sidekick whose thick spectacles come in handy for lighting fires. Although Ralph tries to impose order and delegate responsibility, there are many in their number who would rather swim, play, or hunt the island's wild pig population. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored or challenged outright. His fiercest antagonist is Jack, the redheaded leader of the pig hunters, who manages to lure away many of the boys to join his band of painted savages. The situation deteriorates as the trappings of civilization continue to fall away, until Ralph discovers that instead of being hunters, he and Piggy have become the hunted: \"He forgot his words, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet.\" Golding's gripping novel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition. --Jennifer Hubert","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62e6beb48685143660bab7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.66,"goodreads_ratings":1812737,"level":8,"likeNum":2,"numberOfReading":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books","segments":["5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5d7","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5d8","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5d9","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5da","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5db","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5dc","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5dd","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5de","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5df","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5e0","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5e1","5c29eed9b486852f6a67d5e2"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"威廉戈尔丁","zh_bookname":"蝇王"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.66],"goodreads_ratings":[1812737],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["蝇王"],"author":["William Golding"],"zh_author":["威廉戈尔丁"],"bookname":["Lord of the Flies"]}}

It is a simple moral message about how one must accept the changes in oneself without the fear of an inevitable death and should embrace the new changes as if one is going to live perpetually without an end. All these things were represented by the change in seasons, precisely from cold grey Winter to new full of life Spring. I was moved by how the Poet relates his poetry to communication between a new born baby and the world. \"Don't you know the meaning of the first cry of the new-born child? The child, when it is born, hears at once the cries of the earth and water and sky, which surround him, and they all cry to him, \"We exist,\" and his tiny little heart responds, and cries out in its turn, \"I exist.\" My poetry is like the cry of that new-born child.

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch Scout returns home to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past a journey that can only be guided by one s own conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of the late Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd49b48685135a1f5a67.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.31,"goodreads_ratings":185922,"level":2,"publisher":"HarperCollins","segments":["5c29e12db486852b17db4d85","5c29e12db486852b17db4d86","5c29e12db486852b17db4d87","5c29e12db486852b17db4d88","5c29e12db486852b17db4d89","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8a","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8b","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8c","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8d","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8e","5c29e12db486852b17db4d8f","5c29e12db486852b17db4d90","5c29e12db486852b17db4d91","5c29e12db486852b17db4d92","5c29e12db486852b17db4d93","5c29e12db486852b17db4d94","5c29e12db486852b17db4d95","5c29e12db486852b17db4d96"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"哈珀李","zh_bookname":"设看守人（美国）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.31],"goodreads_ratings":[185922],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["设看守人（美国）"],"author":["Harper Lee"],"zh_author":["哈珀李"],"bookname":["Go Set a Watchman (US)"]}}

Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn't spoken for many years, comes to see her. Gentle gossip about people from Lucy's childhood in Amgash, Illinois, seems to reconnect them, but just below the surface lie the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of Lucy's life: her escape from her troubled family, her desire to become a writer, her marriage, her love for her two daughters.

Yet it is not the city's power brokers that most concern him but rather its ordinary citizens. All Aunt Hagar's Children turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them further north, people who in Jones's masterful hands, emerge as fully human and morally complex, whether they are country folk used to getting up with the chickens or people with centuries of education behind them. In the title story, in which Jones employs the first-person rhythms of a classic detective story, a Korean War veteran investigates the death of a family friend whose sorry destiny seems inextricable from his mother's own violent Southern childhood. In \"In the Blink of God's Eye\" and \"Tapestry\" newly married couples leave behind the familiarity of rural life to pursue lives of urban promise only to be challenged and disappointed. With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw away and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd9ab48685135a214ab8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":1,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd743","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd744","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd745","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd746","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd747","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd748","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd749","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74a","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74b","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74c","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74d","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74e","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd74f","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd750","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd751","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd752","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd753","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd754","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd755","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd756","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd757","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd758","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd759","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd75a","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd75b","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd75c","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd75d","5c29e4c3b486852b17dcd75e"],"year":"","zh_author":"爱德华 P 琼斯","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"夏甲姑妈的孩子们"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["夏甲姑妈的孩子们"],"author":["Edward P Jones"],"zh_author":["爱德华 P 琼斯"],"bookname":["All Aunt Hagar's Children"]}}

Nobel laureate Morrison returns more explicitly to the net of pain cast by slavery, a theme she detailed so memorably in Beloved . Set at the close of the 17th century, the book details America's untoward foundation: dominion over Native Americans, indentured workers, women and slaves. A slave at a plantation in Maryland offers up her daughter, Florens, to a relatively humane Northern farmer, Jacob, as debt payment from their owner. The ripples of this choice spread to the inhabitants of Jacob's farm, populated by women with intersecting and conflicting desires. Jacob's wife, Rebekka, struggles with her faith as she loses one child after another to the harsh New World. A Native servant, Lina, survivor of a smallpox outbreak, craves Florens's love to replace the family taken from her, and distrusts the other servant, a peculiar girl named Sorrow. When Jacob falls ill, all these women are threatened. Morrison's lyricism infuses the shifting voices of her characters as they describe a brutal society being forged in the wilderness. Morrison's unflinching narrative is all the more powerful for its relative brevity; it takes hold of the reader and doesn't let go until the wrenching final-page crescendo. (Nov.) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Bookmarks Magazine Several reviewers ranked A Mercy near the top of Toni Morrison's catalogue an impressive feat. Given the subject of slavery, comparisons with Beloved are inevitable; critics tended to think of A Mercy as a more compact companion piece to that work. Many reviewers also noted that A Mercy is more accessible than Morrison's other novels that were written since she won the Nobel Prize, showing that the award does not, in fact, curse its recipients with literary decline. But a few reviewers also noted the inevitable deference given to an author like Morrison. Some sections of A Mercy may seem obscure, they suggested, but that obscurity simply indicates that those sections deserve another read. The reviewer from the Dallas Morning News summed it up nicely: this novel is more accessible than Morrison's recent work, and is all the better for it. But there is still plenty of allusion and poetry so that you won't forget who you're reading or why there may be a few passages that you're rereading.

In the lucid, unadorned prose that was her hallmark, Cather brings to life the simple Nebraska farm folk and their tranquil rural lifestyle, showing how the Great War, seemingly so far away on the Old Continent, eventually touches them all. More than half of the novel is devoted to the Wheeler homestead, the pace following the slow rhythms of the prairie farmland. The novel's protagonist, Claude Wheeler, a strong, healthy, red-headed farm boy, is physically a typical representative of his sturdy sodbuster family and hard-working neighbors. But mentally the boy has little in common with their narrow outlooks, and the limited horizons of his parochial community make him restless and filled with a barely suppressed discontent. Through a series of striking vignettes, Cather brilliantly reveals Claude's search for some greater purpose to his life beyond the routines of farm life. Gradually, the widening war in Europe sneaks up on the rural Nebraska region, as newspaper reports of refugees and German atrocities begin to stir the emotions of the local young men. When the United States finally enters the conflict, Claude is one of the first to enlist, seeing purpose, adventure, and commitment to some larger ideal in the call to arms. Claude's longings for radically new experiences are more than amply realized overseas in sobering encounters with suffering French women and children, the battle-scarred English \"Tommies, \" and the tenacious German enemy. The novel concludes with a memorable testament to theshattering effects of war on youth and ideals, a powerful depiction of mechanized battle, and its life-changing effects on one Nebraska farm boy and the people he left behind.","comments":[],"copyright":false,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de3fb48685135a2501b5.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.88,"goodreads_ratings":5957,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb55b486852b17dfba2c","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba2d","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba2e","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba2f","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba30","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba31","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba32","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba33","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba34","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba35","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba36","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba37","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba38","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba39","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3a","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3b","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3c","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3d","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3e","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba3f","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba40","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba41","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba42","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba43","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba44","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba45","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba46","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba47","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba48","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba49","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba4a","5c29eb55b486852b17dfba4b"],"year":"1922","zh_author":"薇拉凯瑟","zh_bookname":"我们中间的一个"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.88],"goodreads_ratings":[5957],"year":["1922"],"zh_bookname":["我们中间的一个"],"author":["Willa Cather"],"zh_author":["薇拉凯瑟"],"bookname":["One of Ours"]}}

Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki in 1954 but moved to England in 1960, writes the story of Masuji Ono, a bohemian artist and purveyor of the night life who became a propagandist for Japanese imperialism during the war. But the war is over. Japan lost, Ono's wife and son have been killed, and many young people blame the imperialists for leading the country to disaster. What's left for Ono? Ishiguro's treatment of this story earned a 1986 Whitbread Prize. From Publishers Weekly Like figures on a Japanese screen, the painter Masuji Ono and his daughters Setsuko and Noriko are fixed in the formal attitudes that even their private conversations reflect. In the postwar 1940, the father is a relic of traditional Japan, of teahouses, geishas and patterned gardens not yet destroyed by industry and Westernized thinking. He is unable to communicate with his daughters, unsure of the propriety of his wartime nationalism yet unwilling to exchange it for what seem to him doubtful modern values. His thoughts turn to the optimism of his student days, to uncertainties and disappointments that were mitigated by his sense of a prevailing order, now nowhere apparent. He cannot fathom why his daughters treat him with a disdain that approaches rudeness, why they imply that he and his kind were responsible for the war that killed so many sons, his own among them.

Banks travels to the seething, labyrinthine city of his memory in hopes of solving the mystery of his own, painful past, only to find that war is ravaging Shanghai beyond recognition-and that his own recollections are proving as difficult to trust as the people around him.

Alice Munro s peerless ability to give us the essence of a life in often brief but always spacious and timeless stories is once again everywhere apparent in this brilliant new collection. In story after story, she illumines the moment a life is forever altered by a chance encounter or an action not taken, or by a simple twist of fate that turns a person out of his or her accustomed path and into a new way of being or thinking. A poet, finding herself in alien territory at her first literary party, is rescued by a seasoned newspaper columnist, and is soon hurtling across the continent, young child in tow, toward a hoped-for but completely unplanned meeting. A young soldier, returning to his fianc e from the Second World War, steps off the train before his stop and onto the farm of another woman, beginning a life on the move. A wealthy young woman having an affair with the married lawyer hired by her father to handle his estate comes up with a surprising way to deal with the blackmailer who finds them out.'' While most of these stories take place in Munro s home territory the small Canadian towns around Lake Huron the characters sometimes venture to the cities, and the book ends with four pieces set in the area where she grew up, and in the time of her own childhood: stories autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact. A girl who can t sleep imagines night after wakeful night that she kills her beloved younger sister. A mother snatches up her child and runs for dear life when a crazy woman comes into her yard.'' Suffused with Munro s clarity of vision and her unparalleled gift for storytelling, these tales about departures and beginnings, accidents and dangers, and outgoings and homecomings both imagined and real, paint a radiant, indelible portrait of how strange, perilous, and extraordinary ordinary life can be. Amazon.com Review Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012: You half expect a new collection of stories by the beloved Alice Munro to arrive already devoured: pages dog-eared ( I feel exactly the same way! How did she know? ), spine cracked, cover bent from the dozens of times each story deserves to be read. The best thing to say about Alice Munro is said so often, it doesn t mean much anymore. But here it is for the record: She is a master of her craft. In Dear Life , her 13th collection, Munro again breathes life--real, blemished, nuanced life--into her characters and settings (usually her hometown in Huron County, Ontario). Her empathy is the greatest weapon in her arsenal, and it is on full display here. But the most satisfying part of the new collection is the last four stories, bundled together in what the author calls Finale, the closest she ll ever come to writing about her own dear life. -- Alexandra Foster From Booklist Starred Review Munro s latest collection brings to mind the expression, What is old is new again. As curiously trite and hardly complimentary as that statement may sound, it is offered as unreserved praise for the continued wonderment provided by arguably the best short-story writer in English today. Some of these 14 stories present new directions in Munro s exploration of her well-recognized universe (rural and small-town Ontario), while other stories track more familiar paths, with characters and familial situations reminiscent of previous stories. That said, the truth is that on whatever level of reader familiarity Munro is working, in every story she finds new ways to make the lives of ordinary people compelling. Amundsen has a setting that will pique the interest of avid Munro followers, yet it is delivered with a tone surprising and even disturbing. A young woman ventures to a remote area to assume teaching duties in a TB sanitarium, soon entering into a dismal relationship with the head doctor. But with Munro s care in craftsmanship and her trademark limpid, resonant style, the reader accepts that the depressing aftereffect is Munro s intention. Haven will come to be considered one of her masterpieces: a quick-to-maturation piece, a fond specialty of Munro s, this one is about a teenage girl going to live with her aunt and uncle while her parents do missionary work. In quite dramatic fashion, she observes that what might appear as somone s acceptance of another person s quirks may actually be indifference.

This new collection her most personal to date is no exception. Alice Munro s stories are always wonderful and so ingrained with truths about life that readers always want to know where they came from. In this book, Alice Munro tells us. In her Foreword (an unusual feature in itself), she explains how she, born Alice Laidlaw in Ontario, in recent years became interested in the history of her Laidlaw ancestors. Starting in the wilds of the Scottish Borders, she learned a great deal about a famous ancestor, born around 1700, who, as his tombstone records, for feats of frolic, agility and strength, had no equal in his day. She traced the family s history with the help of that man s nephew, the famous writer James Hogg, finding to her delight that each generation of the family had produced a writer who wanted to record what had befallen them. In this way, she was able to follow the family s voyage to Canada in 1818, and their hard times as pioneers once a father dies on the same day that a daughter is born in the same frontier cabin. I put all this material together over the years, Alice tells us, and almost without my noticing what was happening, it began to shape itself, here and there, into something almost like stories. Some of the characters gave themselves to me in their own words, others rose out of their situations. As the book goes down through the generations, we come to Robert Laidlaw, Alice s father, and then, at the book s heart, the stories become first-person stories, set during her lifetime. So is this a memoir? No. She drew on personal experiences, but then I did anything I wanted to with this material, because the chief thing I was doing was making a story. The resulting collection of stories range from the title story where through a haze of whiskey Alice s ancestors gaze north from Edinburgh Castle at the Fife coast, believing that it is North America all the way to the final story, where we travel with Alice Munro today. In the author s words, these stories pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on. All of them are Alice Munro stories. There could be no higher praise.

In her ninth superlative collection of short fiction, The Love of a Good Woman , the setting is once again western Canada, and the subject matter is classic Munro: secrets, love, betrayal, and the stuff of ordinary lives. But as is usual for this master of the short form, the path she takes is anything but ordinary. The stunning title story is a case in point. A narrative in four parts, it begins with the drowning of a small-town optometrist and ripples outward, touching first the boys who find the body, then a spiteful dying woman and her young practical nurse. Whose tale is this, anyway? Not the optometrist's, surely, though his death holds it together. The effect is not exactly Rashomon -like either, though each of the sections views him through a different eye. Instead, \"The Love of a Good Woman\" is as thorough and inclusive a portrait of small-town life as can be imagined--its tensions and its deceit, its involuntary bonds. Within its 75 pages it encompasses a world more capacious than that of most novels. As always, Munro's prose is both simple and moving, as when the letter-writing protagonist of \"Before the Change\" sends her love to an ex-fianc : What if people really did that--sent their love through the mail to get rid of it? What would it be that they sent? A box of chocolates with centers like the yolks of turkey's eggs. A mud doll with hollow eye sockets. A heap of roses slightly more fragrant than rotten. A package wrapped in bloody newspaper that nobody would want to open. The fictions in this volume burn with a kind of dry-eyed anti-romanticism--even the ones whose plots verge on domestic melodrama (a baby's near-death in \"My Mother's Dream\"; an adulterous wife in \"The Children Stay\"). Densely populated, elliptical in construction, each story circles around its principal events and relationships like planets around a sun. The result is layered and complex, its patterns not always apparent on first reading: in other words, something like life. --Mary Park From Publishers Weekly Again mining the silences and dark discretions of provincial Canadian life, Munro shines in her ninth collection, peopled with characters whose sin is the original one: to have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The good woman of the title story?a practical nurse who has already sacrificed her happiness to keep a deathbed promise?must choose whether to believe another moribund patient's confession or to ignore it and seize a second chance at the life she has missed. The drama of deathbed revelation is acted out, again, between a dying man and the woman at his bedside in \"Cortes Island,\" when a stroke victim exposes his deepest secret to his part-time caretaker, in what may be the last act of intimacy left to him, and in the process puts his finger on the fault lines in her marriage. In the extraordinary \"Before the Change,\" a young woman confronts her father with the open secret of his life and reveals the hidden facts of hers; she is unprepared, however, for the final irony of his legacy. The powerful closing story, \"My Mother's Dream,\" is about a secret in the making, showing how a young mother almost kills her baby and how that near fatality, revealed at last to the daughter when she is 50, binds mother and daughter. Compressing the arc of a novella, Munro's long, spare stories?there are eight here? span decades and lay bare not only the strata of the solitary life but also the seamless connections and shared guilt that bind together even the loneliest of individuals. First serial to the New Yorker. (Nov.) FYI: Four of Munro's previous collections are available in Vintage paperback.

Her father is a famous and fascinating novelist; her older brother, though severely brain-damaged, possesses an almost magical gift for musical composition; and her mother s life is devoted to the care of them both. Ma-chan and her younger brother find themselves emotionally on the outside of this oddly constructed nuclear family. But when her father accepts a visiting professorship from an American university, Ma-chan finds herself suddenly the head of the household and at the center of family relationships that she must begin to redefine. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd15b48685135a1de3d7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.59,"goodreads_ratings":796,"level":3,"publisher":"Grove Press","segments":["5c29de73b486852b17da215b","5c29de73b486852b17da215c","5c29de73b486852b17da215d","5c29de73b486852b17da215e","5c29de73b486852b17da215f","5c29de73b486852b17da2160","5c29de73b486852b17da2161","5c29de73b486852b17da2162","5c29de73b486852b17da2163","5c29de73b486852b17da2164","5c29de73b486852b17da2165"],"year":"1990","zh_author":"大江健三郎","zh_bookname":"平静的生活"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.59],"goodreads_ratings":[796],"year":["1990"],"zh_bookname":["平静的生活"],"author":["Kenzaburo Oe"],"zh_author":["大江健三郎"],"bookname":["A Quiet Life"]}}

Ethan Frome is one of Wharton's most famous works; it is a tightly constructed and almost unbearably heartbreaking story of forbidden love in a snowbound New England village. Summer, also set in rural New England, is often considered a companion to Ethan Frome -Wharton herself called it the hot Ethan-in its portrayal of a young woman's sexual and social awakening. Bunner Sisters takes place in the narrow, dusty streets of late nineteenth-century New York City, where the constrained but peaceful lives of two spinster shopkeepers are shattered when they meet a man who becomes the unworthy focus of all their pent-up hopes. All three of these novellas feature realistic and haunting characters as vivid as any Wharton ever conjured, and together they provide a superb introduction to the shorter fiction of one of our greatest writers.","comments":[],"copyright":false,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd07b48685135a1d8b60.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.82,"goodreads_ratings":198,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House LLC","segments":["5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de48","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de49","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4a","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4b","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4c","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4d","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4e","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de4f","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de50","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de51","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de52","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de53","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de54","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de55","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de56","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de57","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de58","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de59","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5a","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5b","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5c","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5d","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5e","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de5f","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de60","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de61","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de62","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de63","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de64","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de65","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de66","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de67","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de68","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de69","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de6a","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de6b","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de6c","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de6d","5c29ddbdb486852b17d9de6e"],"year":"1917","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"伊桑弗洛姆；夏天；Bunner Sisters（克诺普）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.82],"goodreads_ratings":[198],"year":["1917"],"zh_bookname":["伊桑弗洛姆；夏天；Bunner Sisters（克诺普）"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["Ethan Frome; Summer; Bunner Sisters (Knopf)"]}}

Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly. After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, The House of Mirth, published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. Ethan Frome appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Andr Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London. In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work. The Age of Innocence, a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. - Barnesandnoble.com","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd2db48685135a1e9f1e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3,"goodreads_ratings":1,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dfc6b486852b17daba4e","5c29dfc6b486852b17daba4f","5c29dfc6b486852b17daba50","5c29dfc6b486852b17daba51"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"最小阻力线"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3],"goodreads_ratings":[1],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["最小阻力线"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Line Of Least Resistance"]}}

Her Manhattan is a city of well-appointed drawing rooms, hansoms and broughams, all-night cotillions, and resplendent Fifth Avenue flats. Bishops nieces mingle with bachelor industrialists; respectable wives turn into excellent mistresses. All are governed by a code of behavior as rigid as it is precarious. What fascinates Wharton are the points of weakness in the structure of Old New York: the artists and writers at its fringes, the free-love advocates testing its limits, widows and divorc es struggling to hold their own. The New York Stories of Edith Wharton gathers twenty stories of the city, written over the course of Wharton s career. From her first published story, Mrs. Manstey s View, to one of her last and most celebrated, Roman Fever, this new collection charts the growth of an American master and enriches our understanding of the central themes of her work, among them the meaning of marriage, the struggle for artistic integrity, the bonds between parent and child, and the plight of the aged. Illuminated by Roxana Robinson s Introduction, these stories showcase Wharton s astonishing insight into the turbulent inner lives of the men and women caught up in a rapidly changing society.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3fb48685135a1f1752.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":4,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e0c3b486852b17db1efa","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1efb","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1efc","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1efd","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1efe","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1eff","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1f00","5c29e0c3b486852b17db1f01"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"Edith Wharton诗歌"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["Edith Wharton诗歌"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["Edith Wharton's Verse"]}}

In this set of eight stories, the results are again stunning. In the title story, Brooklyn-to-Seattle transplant Ruma frets about a presumed obligation to bring her widower father into her home, a stressful decision taken out of her hands by his unexpected independence. The alcoholism of Rahul is described by his elder sister, Sudha; her disappointment and bewilderment pack a particularly powerful punch. And in the loosely linked trio of stories closing the collection, the lives of Hema and Kaushik intersect over the years, first in 1974 when she is six and he is nine; then a few years later when, at 13, she swoons at the now-handsome 16-year-old teen's reappearance; and again in Italy, when she is a 37-year-old academic about to enter an arranged marriage, and he is a 40-year-old photojournalist. An inchoate grief for mothers lost at different stages of life enters many tales and, as the book progresses, takes on enormous resonance. Lahiri's stories of exile, identity, disappointment and maturation evince a spare and subtle mastery that has few contemporary equals. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de49b48685135a25535a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.12,"goodreads_ratings":71120,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ebf7b486852b17dffce3","5c29ebf7b486852b17dffce4","5c29ebf7b486852b17dffce5","5c29ebf7b486852b17dffce6","5c29ebf7b486852b17dffce7"],"year":"2008","zh_author":"茱帕 拉希里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"不适之地"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.12],"goodreads_ratings":[71120],"year":["2008"],"zh_bookname":["不适之地"],"author":["Jhumpa Lahiri"],"zh_author":["茱帕 拉希里"],"bookname":["Unaccustomed Earth"]}}

Bridge of Sighs is pure Russo: funny, heartbreaking, and ringing completely true. --Jon Foro From Publishers Weekly Signature Reviewed by Jeffrey FrankRichard Russo's portraits of smalltown life may be read not only as fine novels but as invaluable guides to the economic decline of the American Northeast. Russo was reared in Gloversville, N.Y. (which got its name from the gloves no longer manufactured there), and a lot of mid 20th-century Gloversville can be found in his earlier fiction ( Mohawk ; The Risk Pool ). It reappears in Bridge of Sighs , Russo's splendid chronicle of life in the hollowed-out town of Thomaston, N.Y., where a tannery's runoff is slowly spreading carcinogenic ruin.At the novel's center is Lou C. Lynch (his middle initial wins him the unfortunate, lasting nickname Lucy), but the narrative, which covers more than a half-century, also unfolds through the eyes of Lou's somewhat distant and tormented friend, Bobby Marconi, as well as Sarah Berg, a gifted artist who Lou marries and who loves Bobby, too. The lives of the Lynches, the Bergs and the Marconis intersect in various ways, few of them happy; each family has its share of woe. Lou's father, a genial milkman, is bound for obsolescence and leads his wife into a life of shopkeeping; Bobby's family is being damaged by an abusive father. Sarah moves between two parents: a schoolteacher father with grandiose literary dreams and a scandal in his past and a mother who lives in Long Island and leads a life that is far from exemplary. Russo weaves all of this together with great sureness, expertly planting clues and explosives, too knowing just when and how they will be discovered or detonate at the proper time. Incidents from youth a savage beating, a misunderstood homosexual advance, a loveless seduction have repercussions that last far into adulthood. Thomaston itself becomes a sort of extended family, whose unhappy members include the owners of the tannery who eventually face ruin. Bridge of Sighs is a melancholy book; the title refers to a painting that Bobby is making (he becomes a celebrated artist) and the Venetian landmark, but also to the sadness that pervades even the most contented lives. Lou, writing about himself and his dying, blue-collar town, thinks that the loss of a place isn't really so different from the loss of a person. Both disappear without permission, leaving the self diminished, in need of testimony and evidence. If there are false notes, they come with Russo's portrayal of African-Americans, who too often speak like stock characters: (Doan be given me that hairy eyeball like you doan believe, 'cause I know better, says one). But Russo has a deep and real understanding of stifled ambitions and the secrets people keep, sometimes forever. Bridge of Sighs , on every page, is largehearted, vividly populated and filled with life from America's recent, still vanishing past. Jeffrey Frank's books include The Columnist and Bad Publicity . His novel, Trudy Hopedale , was published in July by Simon &amp; Schuster. Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He left Los Angeles behind for the sort of New England college his parents had aspired to, and now the two of them are back on the Cape - where he'd also spent his childhood vacations - to celebrate the marriage of their daughter Laura's best friend. Sure, Jack's been driving around with his father's ashes in the trunk, though his mother's very much alive and often on his cell phone. Laura's boyfriend seems promising, but be careful what you pray for, especially if it happens to come true. A year later, at her wedding, Jack has another urn in the car, and both he and Joy have brought new dates. Full of every family feeling imaginable, wonderfully comic and profoundly involving, That Old Cape Magic is surprising, uplifting and unlike anything this Pulitzer Prize winner has ever written. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddf9b48685135a237b4e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.31,"goodreads_ratings":15095,"level":2,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e893b486852b17de8e7d","5c29e893b486852b17de8e7e","5c29e893b486852b17de8e7f","5c29e893b486852b17de8e80","5c29e893b486852b17de8e81","5c29e893b486852b17de8e82","5c29e893b486852b17de8e83","5c29e893b486852b17de8e84","5c29e893b486852b17de8e85","5c29e893b486852b17de8e86","5c29e893b486852b17de8e87","5c29e893b486852b17de8e88"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"理查德 罗素","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"那个老斗篷魔术"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.31],"goodreads_ratings":[15095],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["那个老斗篷魔术"],"author":["Richard Russo"],"zh_author":["理查德 罗素"],"bookname":["That Old Cape Magic"]}}

In 1956, Updike published a story, Snowing in Greenwich Village, about a young couple, Joan and Richard Maple, at the beginning of their marriage. Over the next two decades, he returned to these characters again and again, tracing their years together raising children, finding moments of intermittent happiness, and facing the heartbreak of infidelity and estrangement. Seventeen Maples stories were collected in 1979 in a paperback edition titled Too Far to Go, prompted by a television adaptation. Now those stories appear in hardcover for the first time, with the addition of a later story, Grandparenting, which returns us to the Maples s lives long after their wrenching divorce.

He graduated from Harvard College in 1954, and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of The New Yorker . He was the author of more than fifty books, including collections of short stories, poems, essays, and criticism.

Ripped from the headlines doesn't begin to describe Updike's latest, a by-the-numbers novelization of the last five years' news reports on the dangers of home-grown terror that packs a gut punch. Ahmad Mulloy Ashmawy is 18 and attends Central High School in the New York metro area working class city of New Prospect, N.J. He is the son of an Egyptian exchange student who married a working-class Irish-American girl and then disappeared when Ahmad was three. Ahmad, disgusted by his mother's inability to get it together, is in the thrall of Shaikh Rashid, who runs a storefront mosque and preaches divine retribution for \"devils,\" including the \"Zionist dominated federal government.\" The list of devils is long: it includes Joryleen Grant, the wayward African-American girl with a heart of gold; Tylenol Jones, a black tough guy with whom Ahmad obliquely competes for Joryleen's attentions (which Ahmad eventually pays for); Jack Levy, a Central High guidance counselor who at 63 has seen enough failure, including his own, to last him a lifetime (and whose Jewishness plays a part in a manner unthinkable before 9/11); Jack's wife, Beth, as ineffectual and overweight (Updike is merciless on this) as she is oblivious; and Teresa Mulloy, a nurse's aide and Sunday painter as desperate for Jack's attention, when he takes on Ahmad's case, as Jack is for hers. Updike has distilled all their flaws to a caustic, crystalline essence; he dwells on their poor bodies and the debased world in which they move unrelentingly, and with a dispassionate cruelty that verges on shocking. Ahmad's revulsion for American culture doesn't seem to displease Updike one iota. But Updike has also thoroughly digested all of the discursive pap surrounding the post-9/11 threat of terrorism, and that is the real story here. Mullahs, botched CIA gambits, race and class shame (that leads to poor self-worth that leads to vulnerability that leads to extremism), half-baked plots that just might work-all are here, and dispatched with an elegance that highlights their banality and how very real they may be. So smooth is Updike in putting his grotesques through their paces-effortlessly putting them in each others' orbits-that his contempt for them enhances rather than spoils the novel. Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Bookmarks Magazine Not only does John Updike write tales of suburban angst; he also has a long history of ruminating on faith. Critics compare his latest novel to In the Beauty of the Lilies and The Coup except that Terrorist has an intensely contemporary flare. It's almost scandalous to see one of America's literary lions toying with such an inflammatory topic and in the guise of a thriller, no less. The litmus test of his success with Terrorist is whether he answers the central question: What drives someone to become a terrorist? Terrorist is exceedingly well researched, and Updike writes beautifully. Still, many reviewers criticize Updike for creating Ahmad as a puppet rather than a character. That a puppet is exactly what his Imam wishes him to be begs the question whether Ahmad is a successful creation or just a thin caricature.

How rarely it can be said of any of our great American writers that they have been equally gifted in both long and short forms, reads the citation composed for John Updike upon his winning the 2006 Rea Award for the Short Story. Contemplating John Updike s monumental achievement in the short story, one is moved to think of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, Ernest Hemingway, and perhaps William Faulkner writers whose reputations would be as considerable, or nearly, if short stories had been all that they had written. From [his] remarkable early short story collections . . . through his beautifully nuanced stories of family life [and] the bittersweet humors of middle age and beyond . . . John Updike has created a body of work in the notoriously difficult form of the short story to set beside those of these distinguished American predecessors. Congratulations and heartfelt thanks are due to John Updike for having brought such pleasure and such illumination to so many readers for so many years.

The result is less a fluid narrative than an academic exercise, with the bulk of the story Hemingway's travels, escapades, encounters with other writers like F.

John Bedford Lloyd is faced with the burden of providing a passable version of Hemingway's voice and largely succeeds, but it's much more satisfying to listen to Hemingway's son Patrick, and his grandson Se n, who, in addition to sharing their own reminiscences, offer a hint of what Papa himself might have sounded like.

Phenomenal clarity and rapacious movement are only two of the virtues of Millhauser's new collection, which focuses on the misery wrought by misdirected human desire and ambition. The citizens who build insulated domes over their houses in The Dome escalate their ambitions to great literal and figurative heights, but the accomplishment becomes bittersweet. The uncontrollably amused adolescents in the book's title story, who gather together for laughing sessions, find something ultimately joyless in their mirth. As in earlier works like The Barnum Museum , Millhauser's tales evolve more like lyrical essays than like stories; the most breathlessly paced sound the most like essays. The painter at the center of A Precursor of the Cinema develops from entirely conventional works to paintings that blend photographic realism with inexplicable movement, to something entirely new. Similarly, haute couture dresses grow in A Change in Fashion until the people beneath them disappear, and the socioeconomic tension Millhauser induces is as tight as a corset. Though his exaggerated outlook on contemporary life might seem to be at once uncomfortably clinical and fantastical, Millhauser's stories draw us in all the more powerfully, extending his peculiar domain further than ever.

Its November 2004. Barrett Meeks, having lost love yet again, is walking through Central Park when he is inspired to look up at the sky; there he sees a pale, translucent light that seems to regard him in a distinctly godlike way. Barrett doesnt believe in visionsor in Godbut he cant deny what hes seen. At the same time, in the not-quite-gentrified Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, Tyler, Barretts older brother, a struggling musician, is tryingand failingto write a wedding song for Beth, his wife-to-be, who is seriously ill.Tyler is determined to write a song that will be not merely a sentimental ballad but an enduring expression of love. Barrett, haunted by the light, turns unexpectedly to religion. Tyler grows increasingly convinced that only drugs can release his creative powers. Beth tries to face mortality with as much courage as she can summon. Cunningham follows the Meeks brothers as each travels down a different path in his search for transcendence. In subtle, lucid prose, he demonstrates a profound empathy for his conflicted characters and a singular understanding of what lies at thecore of the human soul. The Snow Queen , beautiful and heartbreaking, comic and tragic, proves again that Cunningham is one of the great novelists of his generation.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1eb48685135a1e2b56.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","segments":["5c29def4b486852b17da5720","5c29def4b486852b17da5721","5c29def4b486852b17da5722","5c29def4b486852b17da5723","5c29def4b486852b17da5724","5c29def4b486852b17da5725","5c29def4b486852b17da5726","5c29def5b486852b17da5727","5c29def5b486852b17da5728","5c29def5b486852b17da5729","5c29def5b486852b17da572a","5c29def5b486852b17da572b","5c29def5b486852b17da572c","5c29def5b486852b17da572d","5c29def5b486852b17da572e","5c29def5b486852b17da572f","5c29def5b486852b17da5730","5c29def5b486852b17da5731","5c29def5b486852b17da5732","5c29def5b486852b17da5733","5c29def5b486852b17da5734","5c29def5b486852b17da5735","5c29def5b486852b17da5736","5c29def5b486852b17da5737","5c29def5b486852b17da5738"],"year":"2014","zh_author":"米迦勒坎宁安","zh_bookname":"Snow Queen"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2014"],"zh_bookname":["Snow Queen"],"author":["Michael Cunningham"],"zh_author":["米迦勒坎宁安"],"bookname":["The Snow Queen"]}}

Provincetown, eccentric, physically remote, and heartbreakingly beautiful, has been amenable and intriguing to outsiders for as long as it has existed. \"It is the only small town I know of where those who live unconventionally seem to outnumber those who live within the prescribed bounds of home and licensed marriage, respectable job, and biological children,\" says Cunningham. \"It is one of the places in the world you can disappear into. It is the Morocco of North America, the New Orleans of the north.\" He first came to the place more than twenty years ago, falling in love with the haunted beauty of its seascape and the rambunctious charm of its denizens. Although Provincetown is primarily known as a summer mecca of stunning beaches, quirky shops, and wild nightlife, as well as a popular destination for gay men and lesbians, it is also a place of deep and enduring history, artistic and otherwise. Few towns have attracted such an impressive array of artists and writers--from Tennessee Williams to Eugene O'Neill, Mark Rothko to Robert Motherwell--who, like Cunningham, were attracted to this finger of land because it was . . . different, nonjudgmental, the perfect place to escape to; to be rescued, healed, reborn, or simply to live in peace. As we follow Cunningham on his various excursions through Provincetown and its surrounding landscape, we are drawn into its history, its mysteries, its peculiarities--places you won't read about in any conventional travel guide. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b631eabb4868516aa133a59.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.74,"goodreads_ratings":893,"level":9,"publisher":"Random House, Inc.","segments":["5c29f161b486852f6a68ed2a","5c29f161b486852f6a68ed2b","5c29f161b486852f6a68ed2c","5c29f161b486852f6a68ed2d"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"米迦勒坎宁安","zh_bookname":"土地的尽头：普罗温斯敦的漫步"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.74],"goodreads_ratings":[893],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["土地的尽头：普罗温斯敦的漫步"],"author":["Michael Cunningham"],"zh_author":["米迦勒坎宁安"],"bookname":["Land's End: A Walk in Provincetown"]}}

So begins Jelinek's ( The Piano Teacher ) brilliant new novel, an unrelenting and horrifying exploration of postwar Austria, where the sins of the fathers are visited upon a new generation too disaffected to understand the source of its inarticulate rage. Jelinek's prose is breathless and incisive as she paints psychological portraits of her characters in swift, sure brushstrokes. Among the group of young criminals in the park are Rainer Witkowski, a liar and a coward who fancies himself a poet, an intellectual and a leader of men, and his twin sister, Anna, who responds to rejection by losing her ability to speak. Their father, Otto, is a brutally sadistic, crippled ex-Nazi who takes pornographic pictures of his battered wife and whose sexual abilities are failing now that the aphrodisiac of Auschwitz is only a dim memory.

An unnamed reporter for a local newspaper tries to understand a very modern m nage a trois of flyers on the brainstorming circuit. These characters, Faulkner said, were a fantastic and bizarre phenomenon on the face of the contemporary scene. . . . That is, there was really no place for them in the culture, in the economy, yet they were there, at that time, and everyone knew that they wouldn t last very long, which they didn t. . . . That they were outside the range of God, not only of respectability, of love, but of God too. In Pylon Faulkner set out to test their rootless modernity to see if there is any place in it for the old values of the human heart that are the central concerns of his best fiction. From the Inside Flap The new Vintage edition of the corrected text. About the Author William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously. Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, The Marble Faun , at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, Soldier s Pay , was published in 1926, followed a year later by Mosquitoes , a literary satire. His next book, Flags in the Dust , was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher s insistence and appeared finally as Sartoris in 1929. In the meantime he had completed The Sound and the Fury , and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished Sanctuary and was ready to begin writing As I Lay Dying . That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier. Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels Light in August (1932), Pylon (1935), Absalom, Absalom! (1936), The Unvanquished (1938), The Wild Palms (1939), The Hamlet (1940), and Go Down, Moses (1942) and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on To Have and Have Not , The Big Sleep , and Land of the Pharaohs , among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology The Portable Faulkner brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature. Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in The Sound and the Fury . No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner s imagination, Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley s anthology. The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations. In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Which is why she looks for deeper meaning in nylon slips and train berths. And why, when her lover describes his father's faltering attempt at sex education (\"See The Prairie Lovelies?Only Twenty-five Cents\"), she imagines his family as imbued with \"a sort of decency which surfaces unconsciously.\" It's also why she pictures her father's massive heart attack as \"a tidal wave of pressure, a blind wall?darkness crushing him as he lay sleeping.\" Today, a doctor would give Charleen Prozac and send her on her not-so-merry way. But in 1977, when Shields wrote her second novel (which, like Small Ceremonies, is making its first U.S. appearance), the more common treatment for such neuroses was to endure. Charleen not only endures but comes out stronger after one especially trying weeklong trip across Canada to attend her mother's wedding when she is confronted with more of her past than she?or the reader?expects. It's the sort of experience that should send her completely over the edge, but Charleen isn't quite as fragile as she seems. In less capable hands she'd be a caricature, her transformation contrived. But Shields makes Charleen and her experiences believable. Even more rewarding, she makes them endearing. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.

A fictional autobiography of an ordinary woman, this multi-award-winning book (Pulitzer Prize, National Book Critics Circle Award, and Governor-General's Award) serves as a record of the last century. Daisy Goodwill is on a journey of self-discovery. From her last days in a Florida nursing home she looks back in an attempt to make sense of her life story. Her birth in a turn of the century farmhouse is a shock, born to a woman so obese she doesn't even realize she is pregnant. Widowed on her honeymoon after her husband takes his own life, there is another marriage, children and a beloved hobby that becomes a career, of sorts. It is a life like any other, filled with the richness of human relations and the sting of disappointments both big and small. The beauty of this work lies in the details, the tiny brushstrokes of character and setting, at which Carol Shields is the undisputed master. This engrossing abridged recording was first broadcast on CBC Radio in 1995. Carol Shields both reviewed and approved the abridgement and the recording. Amazon.com Review This fictionalized autobiography of Daisy Goodwill Flett, captured in Daisy's vivacious yet reflective voice, has been winning over readers since its publication in 1995, when it won the Pulitzer Prize. After a youth marked by sudden death and loss, Daisy escapes into conventionality as a middle-class wife and mother. Years later she becomes a successful garden columnist and experiences the kind of awakening that thousands of her contemporaries in mid-century yearned for but missed in alcoholism, marital infidelity and bridge clubs. The events of Daisy's life, however, are less compelling than her rich, vividly described inner life--from her memories of her adoptive mother to her awareness of impending death. Shields' sensuous prose and her deft characterizations make this, her sixth novel, her most successful yet. From Publishers Weekly Any performer has her work cut out for her when a novel takes place in several settings with inhabitants possessing distinctive regional accents. Shield's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel takes the listener from the plains of central Canada to Bloomington, Ind., and the Orkney Islands. Botsford is an excellent performer with a smooth and easy-to-listen-to reading voice, but she doesn't have a gift for imitating linguistic variations. The women of Daisy's Bloomington circle have Southern lilts worthy of Gone with the Wind . Readers would expect the voices of this coterie to age as Daisy does, but no accommodation is made for this possibility. Within each locale the voices are quite distinct, though the voice of Daisy, the center of the novel, stands out least of all, appropriately enough, for in this work we see her life through the eyes of others. This is an important and deft novel and it's about time that it was recorded, even in this overly abridged version. Shields's writing still makes this worth a listen.

A few years later, the family moved to a nearby Polish town of Radzymin. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 21, 1902, a date that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh, and his secretary Dvorah Telushkin.

It is in fact, two separate tales: one of lovely Kasya and her love, John, and their pastoral day in the woods collecting widflowers for their chruch: very beautifully written, the highlight occurs when night falls and the oak, then the pine, then the birch, then the alder all pray to God, with the alder asking for forgiveness since it was the tree whose wood was used for the cross upon which Jesus died. The second half tells thestory of Orso and Jenny, who are the star performers in a circus in Anaheim, California. They object to the harsh trreatment they receive from Mr. Hirsch, the German ringmaster and 'genius of the whip'. Escaping, they cross a desert only to find an old man whose food they share and with whom they live, as it were, happily ever after. Strange bits from Siekiewicz's notebook; strangely inconclusive and strangely put together.

The novel follows the adventures of Macko, a resourceful and wise veteran of war, and his young nephew, Zbyszko, the symbol of a maturing nation, as they struggle, along with the unified peoples of Poland and Lithuania, against the oppressive religious military order, the Teutonic Knights. Among the many memorable characters are Jurand, a merciless, bitter fighter consumed with revenge; his daughter, the innocent Danusia, a girl of twelve who must face the barbarity of the German knighthood; the strong-willed Jagienka, equally adept at shooting a crossbow or administering an estate; Hlawa, a Czech squire of noble birth who is as quick with his wit as he is with his axe; Sanderus, a peddler of religious relics and indulgences whose earthly cravings seem greater than any spiritual needs. A host of other memorable characters fills the canvas set against lush, almost magical forests, dangerous marshes replete with tales of human heads walking on spider legs, winter blizzards that blanket the world in a white wonderland - all at once beautiful and foreboding. Splendid castles are described here, court hunts, single combats that test valor and strength. The customs of knights with their code of honor and feelings of love are adroitly explored. The entirety culminates in one of the most important battles in medieval history, the Battle of Grunwald. The Teutonic Knights was published in America in 1900 in various competing translations of erratic quality. Not until 1943 did a translation worthy of this masterpiece appear, but unfortunately its release was limited to Great Britain. It is this translation that has been revised and edited by Miroslaw Lipinski with an eye for both fluidity in the English language and fidelity to the original Polish.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd7b48685135a22814b.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb89","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8a","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8b","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8c","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8d","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8e","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb8f","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb90","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb91","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb92","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb93","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb94","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb95","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb96","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb97","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb98","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb99","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9a","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9b","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9c","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9d","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9e","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcb9f","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba0","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba1","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba2","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba3","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba4","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba5","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba6","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba7","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba8","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcba9","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbaa","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbab","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbac","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbad","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbae","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbaf","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb0","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb1","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb2","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb3","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb4","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb5","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb6","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb7","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb8","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbb9","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbba","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbbb","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbbc","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbbd","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbbe","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbbf","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbc0","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbc1","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbc2","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbc3","5c29e6d2b486852b17ddcbc4"],"year":"","zh_author":"显克维奇","zh_bookname":"十字军骑士"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["十字军骑士"],"author":["Henryk Sienkiewicz"],"zh_author":["显克维奇"],"bookname":["The Knights of the Cross"]}}

This ebook contains the original content. Fanny Herself is the story of Fanny Brandeis, a sensitive, young Jewish girl coming of age in the Midwest at the turn of the 20th century. It is generally considered to have been based on Ferber s own experiences growing up in Appleton, Wisconsin. Fanny s inner struggle between her compassionate, artistic side and her desire for financial independence as a successful young businesswoman is the recurring theme of the novel. Ferber s engaging style of writing will quickly draw you into her story. Regarded by many to be the greatest American woman novelist of her day, Edna Ferber would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize in a 1925 for her book So Big, and is also the author of Showboat and Cimarron, which along with other of her later works were successfully adapted for stage and screen.

Scrive a chiunque: ad amici, colleghi, parenti, politici, filosofi alla moda, case editrici, politici, e poi a se stesso, e persino a Dio. E su tutti riversa come un fiume in piena il suo temperamento arrogante, le sue idiosincrasie, i suoi fulmini sulla propria professione e sul mondo, ma anche la sua profonda fragilit , la sua invincibile speranza in un mondo migliore, il suo disperato bisogno d amore. Alle lettere di Herzog fa da contrappunto la narrazione di moltissimi episodi evocati dalle lettere stesse, oltre naturalmente a quella degli eventi che riguardano il presente del protagonista, personaggio quanto mai sfaccettato e complesso, certo fra le pi rappresentative e pi potenti figure create dalla narrativa americana nel secondo Novecento. In un miracoloso equilibrio di registri diversi (almeno tre), la vicenda umana del professore in crisi, che Bellow mette in scena con generosi prestiti dalla sua biografia, di quelle che attanagliano l attenzione del lettore e che non la mollano pi fino alla fine, proprio perch il medesimo lettore avverte immediatamente che si sta parlando anche di lui. Personaggio-uomo a tutto tondo, forse uno degli ultimi della non affollata schiera novecentesca, Moses Herzog continua dal 1964, anno in cui vide la luce, ad ammaliarci con i suoi chiaroscuri, a coinvolgerci senza scampo nella sua micidiale altalena di disperazione e di speranza, per farci infine edotti, ma con inscalfibile cognizione di causa, che la vita vale davvero la pena di viverla, qualunque sia quella che ci capita in sorte.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde9b48685135a230baa.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.78,"goodreads_ratings":16672,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e7c1b486852b17de3706","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3707","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3708","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3709","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370a","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370b","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370c","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370d","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370e","5c29e7c1b486852b17de370f","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3710","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3711","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3712","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3713","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3714","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3715","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3716","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3717","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3718","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3719","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371a","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371b","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371c","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371d","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371e","5c29e7c1b486852b17de371f","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3720","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3721","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3722","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3723","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3724","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3725","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3726","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3727","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3728","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3729","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372a","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372b","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372c","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372d","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372e","5c29e7c1b486852b17de372f","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3730","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3731","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3732","5c29e7c1b486852b17de3733"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"索尔 贝娄","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"赫尔佐格"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.78],"goodreads_ratings":[16672],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["赫尔佐格"],"author":["Saul Bellow"],"zh_author":["索尔 贝娄"],"bookname":["Herzog"]}}

Obuhvata vreme od 1807. do 1814. godine i po tome predstavlja klasi an roman vi e od bilo kojeg drugog Andri evog romanskog ostvarenja. Roman je ispripovedan u trecem licu i sklopljen je od prologa, epiloga i 28 poglavlja. Razlika izmedju travnicke i visegradske hronike jeste u tome sto se roman Na Drini cuprija mahom zasniva na fikcionalnoj nadogradnji usmenih legendi dok je Travnicka hronika nastala imaginiranjem vrlo bogate dokumentarne gradje. Hronika o Travniku je beletristicki sedmogodisnji letopis koji obradjuje vreme boravka stranih konzula u tom vezirskom gradu. Pocinje dolaskom francuskog konzula, a zavrsava se odlaskom drugopostavljenog austrijskog konzula. Prema poetickom pravilu koje vazi za sve Andriceve romane (izuzimajuci donekle Gospodjicu) i ovaj roman okrenut je istoriji. U procesu stvaranja Travnicke hronike Andric se sluzio bogatom dokumentarnom gradjom iz oblasti istorije civilizacije, etnologije i autenticnim spisima o istorijskim licnostima koje su predstavljene u romanu. Istorija je \"utkana tako reci, u svaku recenicu (do te mere, ponekad, da bi se mogle staviti, pri dnu stranice referencije izvora), dajuci joj na taj nacin izvesnu autenticnost i zivotnost\", napisao

The New York Times Portugal, 1711. The Portuguese king promises the greedy prelates of the Church an expansive new convent, should they intercede with God to give him an heir. A lonely priest works in maniacal solitude on his Passarola, a heretical flying machine he hopes will allow him to soar far from the madness surrounding him. A young couple, brought together by chance, live out a sweet, if tormented, romance. Meanwhile, amid the fires and horrors of the Inquisition, angry crowds and abused peasants rejoice in spectacles of cruelty, from bullfighting to auto-da-fe; disgraced priests openly flout God s laws; and chaos reigns over a society on the brink of disaster. Weaving together multiple storylines to present both breathtaking fiction and incisive commentary, renowned Portuguese writer and winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature, Jos Saramago spins an epic and captivating yarn, equal parts historical fiction, political satire, religious criticism, and whimsical romance. Hailed by USA Today as an unexpected gem, Baltasar and Blimunda is a captivating literary tour de force, full of magic and adventure, exquisite historical detail, and the power of both human folly and human will.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd2bb48685135a1e9597.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.91,"goodreads_ratings":12989,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dfb3b486852b17dab1a7","5c29dfb3b486852b17dab1a8","5c29dfb3b486852b17dab1a9","5c29dfb3b486852b17dab1aa","5c29dfb3b486852b17dab1ab"],"year":"1998","zh_author":"萨拉马戈","zh_bookname":"修道院纪事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.91],"goodreads_ratings":[12989],"year":["1998"],"zh_bookname":["修道院纪事"],"author":["Jose Saramago"],"zh_author":["萨拉马戈"],"bookname":["Baltasar and Blimunda"]}}

Raimundo Silva is a middle-aged, celibate clerk, proofing manuscripts for a respectable publishing house. Fluent in Portuguese, he has been assigned to work on a standard history of the country, and the twelfth-century king who laid siege to Lisbon. In a moment of subversive daring, Raimundo decides to change just one single word of text a capricious revision that completely undoes the past. When discovered, his insolent disregard for facts appalls his employers save for his new editor, Maria Sara. She suggests that Rainmundo take his transgressions even further. Through Rainmundo and Maria s eyes, what transpires is an alternate view of history and a colorful reinvention of a debatable truth. It s a serpentine journey through time where past and present converge, fact becomes myth, and fiction and reality blur especially for Rainmundo and Maria themselves, who begin to find themselves erotically drawn to each other. Walter Mitty has nothing on Raimundo Silva . . . this hypnotic tale is a great comic romp through history, language and the imagination.

In the Sydney suburb of Centennial Park, three nurses, a housekeeper and a solicitor attend to Elizabeth as her son and daughter convene at her deathbed. But, in death as in life, Elizabeth remains a destructive force on those who surround her.

Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal Here are two memorable novellas--complete, evocative worlds in miniature--by the author of The Greenlanders ( LJ 4/15/88). In \"Ordinary Love,\" a mother explores her tentative relationship with her five grown children on the return of one of her twin boys from two years in India. After she reveals to them information about the brief affair that caused the collapse of her marriage to their father 20 years earlier, and her loss of custody, they tell heartbreaking details of their years without her. \"Good Will\" is a powerhouse: the careful, totally \"organic\" lifestyle of a rural couple disintegrates before their eyes when their seven-year-old son confronts the \"real world\" at school, with anguishing results.

Moving from post-World War I America through the early 1950s, Some Luck gives us an intimate look at this family's triumphs and tragedies, zooming in on the realities of farm life, while casting-as the children grow up and scatter to New York, California, and everywhere in between-a panoramic eye on the monumental changes that marked the first half of the twentieth century. Rich with humor and wisdom, twists and surprises, Some Luck takes us through deeply emotional cycles of births and deaths, passions, and betrayals, displaying Smiley's dazzling virtuosity, compassion, and understanding of human nature and the nature of history, never discounting the role of fate and chance.

Only one will remain in Iowa to work the land, while the others scatter to Washington, D.C., California, and everywhere in between. As the country moves out of post--World War II optimism through the darker landscape of the Cold War and the social and sexual revolutions of the 1960s and '70s, and then into the unprecedented wealth--for some--of the early 1980s, the Langdon children each follow a different path in a rapidly changing world.

One night in the late 1930s, in a bar on the Illinois Iowa border, John Vincent Atanasoff, a professor of physics at Iowa State University, after a frustrating day performing tedious mathematical calculations in his lab, hit on the idea that the binary number system and electronic switches, com bined with an array of capacitors on a moving drum to serve as memory, could yield a computing machine that would make his life and the lives of other similarly burdened scientists easier. Then he went back and built the machine. It worked. The whole world changed. Why don t we know the name of John Atanasoff as well as we know those of Alan Turing and John von Neumann? Because he never patented the device, and because the developers of the far-better-known ENIAC almost certainly stole critical ideas from him. But in 1973 a court declared that the patent on that Sperry Rand device was invalid, opening the intellectual property gates to the computer revolution. Jane Smiley tells the quintessentially American story of the child of immigrants John Atanasoff with technical clarity and narrative drive, making the race to develop digital computing as gripping as a real-life techno-thriller.

He is regarded as a major \"innovator in the art of the short story\"; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and his best work speaks to a versatile and luminous narrative gift. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in English, in both prose and verse, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English language writer to receive the prize, and he remains today its youngest-ever recipient.

Few of Kipling's fictional stories contain much of an autobiographical element, despite his frequent use of the first person. In this collection of stories, the school and some of the characters are based on his own experiences; Beetle, in particular, is a self portrait. The Devon boarding school portrayed in the book is basically a factory for producing future officers of the British army to serve in the colonies, and is by modern standards a violent place, with bullying and savage corporal punishment. Yet Kipling's evident nostalgia for his time at the school infects the reader, who senses the intensity of the friendships and the enjoyment of the experiences, which mainly focus on triumphs over the more petty minded masters. The success of his treatment makes a modern reader quite uncomfortable, especially when he seems to have fond memories of bullying. The way that his schoolboys rebel against authority was controversial at the time, but much less so now. Times have changed. The reader is also made aware, more deliberately, of a different dark undercurrent. Sprinkled throughout the stories are notes about the future deaths of the boys; they are destined to die young in the service of the British Empire. (One of them, interestingly, is going to be shot by his own men, a less glorified death than the others.) Kipling's point is presumably that the Empire was maintained at a human cost; despite his reputation as a jingoist, this is not the only place where he showed an awareness of this. Few today would deny that there was a human cost, though the focus has canged so that we would think about what it meant to the colonised rather than the coloniser. Stalky and Co. is one of the most uncomfortable of Kipling's books to read, and this is a measure of the author's talent, as he glories in what is to us unpalatable and almost brings us to feel we appreciate it too.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de5fb48685135a25e8ab.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ed09b486852b17e07598","5c29ed09b486852b17e07599","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759a","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759b","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759c","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759d","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759e","5c29ed09b486852b17e0759f","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a0","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a1","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a2","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a3","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a4","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a5","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a6","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a7","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a8","5c29ed09b486852b17e075a9","5c29ed09b486852b17e075aa","5c29ed09b486852b17e075ab","5c29ed09b486852b17e075ac","5c29ed09b486852b17e075ad","5c29ed09b486852b17e075ae"],"year":"","zh_author":"鲁德亚德 吉卜林","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"Stalky´╝ćCo"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["Stalky´╝ćCo"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["鲁德亚德 吉卜林"],"bookname":["Stalky & Co"]}}

In this tour de force of fact and fiction, Philip Roth meets a man who may or may not be Philip Roth.

Suspenseful, hilarious, hugely impassioned, pulsing with intelligence and narrative energy, Operation Shylock is at once a spy story, a political thriller, a meditation on identity, and a confession. Like Pushkin and Dostoevsky before him, Philip Roth takes on the subject of the writer s double, which for Roth is inevitably bound up in Jewishness and identity. This is a bold, inventive and energetic departure from his past novels, a meta-novel, and, like all of his writing, full of ideas, wit, humor and startling observation.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb2b48685135a2201b6.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.77,"goodreads_ratings":3349,"level":3,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster","segments":["5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6502","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6503","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6504","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6505","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6506","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6507","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6508","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd6509","5c29e5ffb486852b17dd650a"],"year":"1993","zh_author":"菲利普罗斯","zh_bookname":"夏洛克行动"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.77],"goodreads_ratings":[3349],"year":["1993"],"zh_bookname":["夏洛克行动"],"author":["Philip Roth"],"zh_author":["菲利普罗斯"],"bookname":["Operation Shylock"]}}

The family house is in the small town of Fingerbone on a glacial lake in the Far West, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town \"chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere.\" Ruth and Lucille's struggle toward adulthood beautifully illuminates the price of loss and survival, and the dangerous and deep undertow of transience.

Duane Moore first made his appearance in The Last Picture Show and, like his author, he has aged but not lost his vigor or his taste for life. Back from a two-week trip to Egypt, Duane finds he cannot readjust to life in Thalia, the small, dusty, West Texas hometown in which he has spent all of his life. In the short time he was away, it seems that everything has changed alarmingly. His office barely has a reason to exist now that his son Dickie is running the company from Wichita Falls, his lifelong friends seem to have suddenly grown old, his familiar hangout, once a good old-fashioned convenience store, has been transformed into an \"Asian Wonder Deli,\" his daughters seem to have taken leave of their senses and moved on to new and strange lives, and his own health is at serious risk. It's as if Duane cannot find any solace or familiarity in Thalia and cannot even bring himself to revisit the house he shared for decades with his late wife, Karla, and their children and grandchildren. He spends his days aimlessly riding his bicycle (already a sign of serious eccentricity in West Texas) and living in his cabin outside town. The more he tries to get back to the rhythm of his old life, the more he realizes that he should have left Thalia long ago -- indeed everybody he cared for seems to have moved on without him, to new lives or to death. The only consolation is meeting the young, attractive geologist, Annie Cameron, whom Dickie has hired to work out of the Thalia office. Annie is brazenly seductive, yet oddly cold, young enough to be Duane's daughter, or worse, and Duane hasn't a clue how to handle her. He's also in love with his psychiatrist, Honor Carmichael, who after years of rebuffing him, has decided to undertake what she feels is Duane's very necessary sex reeducation, opening him up to some major, life-changing surprises. For the lesson of When the Light Goes is that where there's life, there is indeed hope -- Duane, widowed, displaced from whatever is left of his own life, suddenly rootless in the middle of his own hometown, and at risk of death from a heart that also doesn't seem to be doing its job, is in the end saved by sex, by love, and by his own compassionate and intense interest in other people and the surprises they reveal. At once realistic and life-loving, often hilariously funny, and always moving, though without a touch of sentimentality, Larry McMurtry has opened up a new chapter in Duane's life and, in doing so, written one of his finest and most compelling novels to date, doing for Duane what he did so triumphantly for Aurora in Terms of Endearment .

As this finale opens, Tasmin and her family are under irksome, though comfortable, arrest in Mexican Santa Fe. Her father, the eccentric Lord Berrybender, is planning to head for Texas with his whole family and his retainers, English, American, and Native American. Tasmin, who would once have followed her husband, Jim Snow, anywhere, is no longer even sure she likes him, or knows where to go to next. Neither does anyone else -- even Captain Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame, is puzzled by the great changes sweeping over the West, replacing red men and buffalo with towns and farms. In the meantime, Jim Snow, accompanied by Kit Carson, journeys to New Orleans, where he meets up with a muscular black giant named Juppy, who turns out to be one of Lord Berrybender's many illegitimate offspring, and in whose company they make their way back to Santa Fe. But even they are unable to prevent the Mexicans from carrying the Berrybender family on a long and terrible journey across the desert to Vera Cruz. Starving, dying of thirst, and in constant, bloody battle with slavers pursuing them, the Berrybenders finally make their way to civilization -- if New Orleans of the time can be called that -- where Jim Snow has to choose between Tasmin and the great American plains, on which he has lived all his life in freedom, and where, after all her adventures, Tasmin must finally decide where her future lies. With a cast of characters that includes almost every major real-life figure of the West, Folly and Glory is a novel that represents the culmination of a great and unique four-volume saga of the early days of the West; it is one of Larry McMurtry's finest achievements.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd34b48685135a1ed49e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.64,"goodreads_ratings":3632,"level":3,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster","segments":["5c29e038b486852b17dae426","5c29e038b486852b17dae427","5c29e038b486852b17dae428","5c29e038b486852b17dae429","5c29e038b486852b17dae42a","5c29e038b486852b17dae42b","5c29e038b486852b17dae42c","5c29e038b486852b17dae42d","5c29e038b486852b17dae42e","5c29e038b486852b17dae42f","5c29e038b486852b17dae430","5c29e038b486852b17dae431","5c29e038b486852b17dae432","5c29e038b486852b17dae433","5c29e038b486852b17dae434","5c29e038b486852b17dae435","5c29e038b486852b17dae436","5c29e038b486852b17dae437","5c29e038b486852b17dae438","5c29e038b486852b17dae439","5c29e038b486852b17dae43a","5c29e038b486852b17dae43b","5c29e038b486852b17dae43c","5c29e038b486852b17dae43d","5c29e038b486852b17dae43e","5c29e038b486852b17dae43f","5c29e038b486852b17dae440","5c29e038b486852b17dae441","5c29e038b486852b17dae442","5c29e038b486852b17dae443","5c29e038b486852b17dae444","5c29e038b486852b17dae445","5c29e038b486852b17dae446","5c29e038b486852b17dae447","5c29e038b486852b17dae448","5c29e038b486852b17dae449","5c29e038b486852b17dae44a","5c29e038b486852b17dae44b","5c29e038b486852b17dae44c","5c29e038b486852b17dae44d","5c29e038b486852b17dae44e","5c29e038b486852b17dae44f","5c29e038b486852b17dae450","5c29e038b486852b17dae451","5c29e038b486852b17dae452","5c29e038b486852b17dae453","5c29e038b486852b17dae454","5c29e038b486852b17dae455","5c29e038b486852b17dae456","5c29e038b486852b17dae457","5c29e038b486852b17dae458","5c29e038b486852b17dae459","5c29e038b486852b17dae45a","5c29e038b486852b17dae45b","5c29e038b486852b17dae45c","5c29e038b486852b17dae45d","5c29e038b486852b17dae45e","5c29e038b486852b17dae45f","5c29e038b486852b17dae460","5c29e038b486852b17dae461","5c29e038b486852b17dae462","5c29e038b486852b17dae463","5c29e038b486852b17dae464","5c29e038b486852b17dae465","5c29e038b486852b17dae466","5c29e038b486852b17dae467","5c29e038b486852b17dae468","5c29e038b486852b17dae469","5c29e038b486852b17dae46a","5c29e038b486852b17dae46b","5c29e038b486852b17dae46c","5c29e038b486852b17dae46d","5c29e038b486852b17dae46e","5c29e038b486852b17dae46f","5c29e038b486852b17dae470","5c29e038b486852b17dae471","5c29e038b486852b17dae472","5c29e038b486852b17dae473","5c29e038b486852b17dae474","5c29e038b486852b17dae475","5c29e038b486852b17dae476","5c29e038b486852b17dae477"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"罪恶的杀手；流浪的山；悲伤的河流；愚蠢和荣耀"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.64],"goodreads_ratings":[3632],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["罪恶的杀手；流浪的山；悲伤的河流；愚蠢和荣耀"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["Sin Killer; The Wandering Hill; by Sorrow's River; Folly and Glory"]}}

All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers is a wonderful display of Larry McMurtry's unique gift: his ability to re-create the subtle textures of feelings, the claims of passing time and familiar place, and the rich interlocking swirl of people's lives.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd55b48685135a1fb038.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.9,"goodreads_ratings":2704,"level":2,"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","segments":["5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fb6","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fb7","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fb8","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fb9","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fba","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fbb","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fbc","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fbd","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fbe","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fbf","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc0","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc1","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc2","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc3","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc4","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc5","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc6","5c29e1ceb486852b17db8fc7"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"我所有的朋友都将成为陌生人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.9],"goodreads_ratings":[2704],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["我所有的朋友都将成为陌生人"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers"]}}

The story examines the world through the reminiscences of a young girl and explores such themes as nature and how we are able to shape the world around us by how we perceive it. The novelette gives readers a prime example of Pasternak's signature style and use of poetics, imagery, and lyricism in prose. The Adolescence of Zhenya Luvers is one of Pasternak's very first stories, and it originally appeared in a collection by the same name, published in 1925.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd82b48685135a209073.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.47,"goodreads_ratings":79,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e366b486852b17dc4be9","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bea","5c29e366b486852b17dc4beb","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bec","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bed","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bee","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bef","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf0","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf1","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf2","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf3","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf4","5c29e366b486852b17dc4bf5"],"year":"1961","zh_author":"鲍里斯 帕斯捷尔纳克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"Zhenya Luvers的青春期"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.47],"goodreads_ratings":[79],"year":["1961"],"zh_bookname":["Zhenya Luvers的青春期"],"author":["Boris Pasternak"],"zh_author":["鲍里斯 帕斯捷尔纳克"],"bookname":["The Adolescence of Zhenya Luvers"]}}

Memoires like these are not intended to linearly, chronologically, tell all there is to tell, recount all possible facts, words, actions, events. On the contrary: they are intended to provide an atmosphere. Yeats warns us in the beginning that what he remembers might not be what happened, but of course, he knows that one becomes who one is as much through the events as through the remembering of them - and that remembering might not be factual. SO that's what we get, in beautiful prose (prose: not an imitation of poetry): memories of people, of events, memories of memories, touches of coulour, quick sketching of characters (in the sense of people who stood out for him). Impressions, emotions, recollections, and how they shaped Yeats the poet. Do not expect to come to know about Yeats himself, the process of poetic creation, life in Ireland and all that, and do not expect him to name names: it's someone casting an eye - and an ear - on the past. His net is narrow, and what it catches is incidental: the beauty is in the process, and in coming to understand how you became yourself. Beautiful.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd17b48685135a1df3e8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.06,"goodreads_ratings":36,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29de94b486852b17da2c76","5c29de94b486852b17da2c77","5c29de94b486852b17da2c78","5c29de94b486852b17da2c79","5c29de94b486852b17da2c7a","5c29de94b486852b17da2c7b","5c29de94b486852b17da2c7c","5c29de94b486852b17da2c7d","5c29de94b486852b17da2c7e"],"year":"","zh_author":"叶芝","zh_bookname":"对童年和青春的遐想"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.06],"goodreads_ratings":[36],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["对童年和青春的遐想"],"author":["William Butler Yeats"],"zh_author":["叶芝"],"bookname":["Reveries over Childhood and Youth"]}}

Rather than a discussion on good and evil as conditions of the human soul, this was a collection of essays about art written during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. (See titles below) Some discussions were perhaps more relevant during the time the essays were written, but most of Yeats thoughts could, with a little effort, be applied to today s world. His thoughts on symbolism versus allegory, art as the theatre of commerce versus art as a great Passion and the essays on William Blake are marvellous. Underpinning his thoughts is Yeats fascination with spiritual mysticism and, for me, this adds a layer of meaning to his words that speaks to my soul of things Divine and Eternal; he touches on the great mystery of what makes great art rather than popular art by comparing the artistic life with the spiritual life of the religious mystic. This was both inspiring and comforting, and reminded me of why I continue to write the stories and poems that I do. IDEAS OF GOOD AND EVIL was not always an easy book to read; it requires concentration, as the style does reflect that of Yeats own era, but the insights and wisdom that imbue Yeats work with both magic and passion make the effort worth it. Essays included in Ideas of Good and Evil by W B Yeats: What is 'popular poetry'?

The version I read was dated published in 1911 and was quite different from his original. The play is set in Ireland during the awful years of the famine. We begin in the small cottage belonging to Shemus and Mary Rua and their son Tieg. Mary and Tieg are waiting for Shemus to return; he left many hours ago promising to bring home either food or money. But he comes home empty handed. Something evil is about in the night, for Tieg had seen two owls with human faces in the bushes outside the cottage. These turn out to be demons who enter the house in the form of Merchants and offer to pay good money for souls. Shemus and Tieg are eager to accept; they feel that since God has turned away from the people, they should look elsewhere themselves. But the deal is they must go and spread the word about the two 'merchants' and their business. They agree to this and run out into the night, leaving Mary, who confronts the demons but faints when they explain what her future will be if she refuses to sell her soul. The Countess Cathleen and her two companions Aleel and Oona had passed by earlier, on their way to her grand house. She is a sad woman, distressed over the conditions of the people and the land, and has decided to do as much as she can for them. She orders her steward to sell all of her property except for this house and use the proceeds to buy as much grain and cattle as he can, and bring them to the house for distribution as soon as possible. But the demons are going about their business, and of course they meddle with the Countess, who decides that there is only one thing she can do to truly help the people and the country itself. Does she have the courage to do this thing? Who will win the final battle between Good and Evil, which will be triggered by Cathleen's decision? And is what the angel tells Aleel in the final scene really true? Or merely a justification for 'sin'? No wonder this play was controversial in its day. When reading plays, I always think of how they would appear on stage. This one would be dark and dramatic, although I couldn't help but laugh a bit at the two Merchants and the water spirits in Scene 3. I am not sure I should have laughed, but the interaction between them all struck me as funny. I would like to read more work by Yeats, another of those authors who somehow managed to spend years of my life being neglected.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de50b48685135a2587ed.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.17,"goodreads_ratings":103,"level":4,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ec5cb486852b17e02942","5c29ec5cb486852b17e02943","5c29ec5cb486852b17e02944","5c29ec5cb486852b17e02945","5c29ec5cb486852b17e02946"],"year":"","zh_author":"叶芝","zh_bookname":"凯瑟琳女伯爵"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.17],"goodreads_ratings":[103],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["凯瑟琳女伯爵"],"author":["William Butler Yeats"],"zh_author":["叶芝"],"bookname":["The Countess Cathleen"]}}

At the heart of these stories is the irrepressible, irresistible Yunior, a young hardhead whose longing for love is equaled only by his recklessness--and by the extraordinary women he loves and loses: artistic Alma; the aging Miss Lora; Magdalena, who thinks all Dominican men are cheaters; and the love of his life, whose heartbreak ultimately becomes his own. In prose that is endlessly energetic, inventive, tender, and funny, the stories in *This Is How You Lose Her* lay bare the infinite longing and inevitable weakness of the human heart. They remind us that passion always triumphs over experience, and that the half-life of love is forever.

Through a complicated web of secrets and historical references, Mario Vargas Llosa analyzes the mental and moral mechanisms that govern power and the people behind it.

This technique is as annoying as it is helpful, making the recording sound more like a grade school teacher reading aloud rather than a sophisticated audiobook production. Inmate Ray is working on a gothic novel at his prison's writing workshop. Eagan alternates chapters between him in prison and the adventures of his alter ego, Danny, within the novel. The speech patterns of Ray's fellow inmates are nicely individualized, but the women who inhabit the embedded novel are too similar. Geneva Carr appears only in the third part of the novel (on the last disc). As the voice of Ray's creative writing teacher and love interest, Carr explores the complexities of a woman who falls for a prisoner and makes listeners wish she'd had more to do in this production. The Keep is a clever, quirky novel that ping-pongs the listener between a medieval castle that kept people out and a modern prison that fences people in until the two worlds collide. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde0b48685135a22c4be.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.44,"goodreads_ratings":11497,"level":2,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e746b486852b17ddfef9","5c29e746b486852b17ddfefa","5c29e746b486852b17ddfefb","5c29e746b486852b17ddfefc","5c29e746b486852b17ddfefd","5c29e746b486852b17ddfefe","5c29e746b486852b17ddfeff","5c29e746b486852b17ddff00","5c29e746b486852b17ddff01","5c29e746b486852b17ddff02","5c29e746b486852b17ddff03","5c29e746b486852b17ddff04","5c29e746b486852b17ddff05","5c29e746b486852b17ddff06","5c29e746b486852b17ddff07","5c29e746b486852b17ddff08","5c29e746b486852b17ddff09","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0a","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0b","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0c","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0d","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0e","5c29e746b486852b17ddff0f","5c29e746b486852b17ddff10","5c29e746b486852b17ddff11","5c29e746b486852b17ddff12","5c29e746b486852b17ddff13","5c29e746b486852b17ddff14"],"year":"2007","zh_author":"珍妮弗 伊根","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"保持"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.44],"goodreads_ratings":[11497],"year":["2007"],"zh_bookname":["保持"],"author":["Jennifer Egan"],"zh_author":["珍妮弗 伊根"],"bookname":["The Keep"]}}

In Love Day , twenty-year-old Paul Whitehurst is a Marine lieutenant during World War II, waiting to land on Okinawa, wrestling with anxiety and memories of his boyhood in Virginia. In Shadrach , ten-year-old Paul witnesses his neighbors as they welcome a guest: a ninety-nine-year-old former slave who has walked nine hundred miles from Alabama so that he may die on the land of his childhood owner. And in A Tidewater Morning , Paul is thirteen and struggling to deal with his mother s impending death from cancer. Together in one volume, each of these affecting semiautobiographical novellas from the author of such literary classics as the Pulitzer Prize winning The Confessions of Nat Turner and the memoir Darkness Visible , weaves together the transformative experiences of Whitehurst s early life with William Styron s signature deep historical insight, underscoring how the significance of the past informs the present. As the Los Angeles Times notes, it is one of Styron s finest works. . . . The beauty and humanity of the Southern tradition are evoked vividly.

Intended to beat discipline into the aging reservists, the march instead rankles marines Culver and Mannix, whose growing resentment of the brutal trek leads to an ultimate, powerful act of rebellion.

Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of The Stranger , however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy. The plot is simple. A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable. Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate, clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. \"She wanted to know if I loved her,\" he says of his girlfriend. \"I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't.\" There's a latent ominousness in such observations, a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation; however, his confrontation with \"the gentle indifference of the world\" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. --Ben Guterson From Library Journal The new translation of Camus's classic is a cultural event; the translation of Cocteau's diary is a literary event. Both translations are superb, but Ward's will affect a naturalized narrative, while Browner's will strengthen Cocteau's reemerging critical standing. Since 1946 untold thousands of American students have read a broadly interpretative, albeit beautifully crafted British Stranger . Such readers have closed Part I on \"door of undoing\" and Part II on \"howls of execration.\" Now with the domestications pruned away from the text, students will be as close to the original as another language will allow: \"door of unhappiness\" and \"cries of hate.\" Browner has no need to \"write-over\" another translation. With Cocteau's reputation chiefly as a cineaste until recently, he has been read in French or not at all. Further, the essay puts a translator under less pressure to normalize for readers' expectations. Both translations show the current trend to stay closer to the original.

For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the \"essential dimensions\" of human nature, manifested in man's timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history. And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times.

The unstated objective of his lecture (\"Existentialism Is a Humanism\") was to expound his philosophy as a form of \"existentialism\", a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity. The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence his self, his being through the choices he freely makes ('existence precedes essence\"). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind. This edition of Existentialism Is a Humanism is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette Elka m-Sartre s introduction and a Q&amp;A with Sartre about his lecture. Paired with \"Existentialism Is a Humanism is another seminal Sartre text, his commentary on Camus s The Stranger . In her foreword, intended for an American audience, acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal offers an assessment of both works.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd68b48685135a1ffd4d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.84,"goodreads_ratings":4078,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e24fb486852b17dbce65","5c29e24fb486852b17dbce66"],"year":"","zh_author":"让 保罗 萨特","zh_author_from":"google_translation","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"存在主义与人类情感"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.84],"goodreads_ratings":[4078],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["存在主义与人类情感"],"author":["Jean-Paul Sartre"],"zh_author":["让 保罗 萨特"],"bookname":["Existentialism & Human Emotions"]}}

By a great gift of intuition she has entered into the mind, heart and spirit of the Chinese peasant woman and revealed the permanent values of life. The *Times Literary Supplement * Dickensian in its epic sweep, one of Bucks finest novels centers on an unnamed peasant woman in pre-revolutionary China. Without warning, her restless husband abandons her. Shamed by the experience, she is left to work the land, raise their three children on her own, and care for her aging mother-in-law. To save face with her neighbors, she pretends her husband is traveling, and sends letters to herself signed in his name. Surrounded by poverty, despair, and a growing web of lies meant to protect the family, her children grow up and enter society with only the support of their mothers unbreakable will.An unforgettable story of one womans strength and a remarkable fable about the role of mothers, this novel is a powerful achievement by a master of twentieth-century fiction.This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S.

If you are a father or a mother with young or grown-up children; if you are a young man or a young woman looking into the bewildering world beyond the shelter of parents or college; if you are curious about human problems today - Sinclair Lewis' novel will absorb you and entertain you. With his genius for dramatizing thoughts that are on the threshold of every mind, he writes with affectionate sympathy of the problems of the successful man of fifty-five, his son and daughter, his wife, his business. Harry Sinclair Lewis was an American novelist, short-story writer, and playwright. In 1930, he became the first writer from the United States to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humour, new types of characters.\" His works are known for their insightful and critical views of American society and capitalist values, as well as for their strong characterizations of modern working women.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd30b48685135a1ebb56.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.29,"goodreads_ratings":35,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e003b486852b17dacf21","5c29e003b486852b17dacf22","5c29e003b486852b17dacf23","5c29e003b486852b17dacf24","5c29e003b486852b17dacf25","5c29e003b486852b17dacf26","5c29e003b486852b17dacf27","5c29e003b486852b17dacf28","5c29e003b486852b17dacf29","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2a","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2b","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2c","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2d","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2e","5c29e003b486852b17dacf2f","5c29e003b486852b17dacf30","5c29e003b486852b17dacf31","5c29e003b486852b17dacf32","5c29e003b486852b17dacf33","5c29e003b486852b17dacf34","5c29e003b486852b17dacf35","5c29e003b486852b17dacf36","5c29e003b486852b17dacf37","5c29e003b486852b17dacf38","5c29e003b486852b17dacf39","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3a","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3b","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3c","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3d","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3e","5c29e003b486852b17dacf3f","5c29e003b486852b17dacf40","5c29e003b486852b17dacf41","5c29e003b486852b17dacf42","5c29e003b486852b17dacf43","5c29e003b486852b17dacf44","5c29e003b486852b17dacf45","5c29e003b486852b17dacf46","5c29e003b486852b17dacf47","5c29e003b486852b17dacf48"],"year":"","zh_author":"辛克莱刘易斯","zh_bookname":"浪子父母"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.29],"goodreads_ratings":[35],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["浪子父母"],"author":["Sinclair Lewis"],"zh_author":["辛克莱刘易斯"],"bookname":["The Prodigal Parents"]}}

Set in Cairo in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of 1967, Love in the Rain introduces us to an assortment of characters who, each in his or her own way, experience the effects of this calamitous event. The war and its casualties, as well as people's foibles and the tragedies they create for themselves, raise existential questions that cannot easily be answered. In a frank, sensitive treatment of everything from patriotism to prostitution, homosexuality and lesbianism, Love in the Rain presents a struggle between \"old\" and \"new\" in the realm of moral values that leaves the future in doubt. Through the dilemmas and heartbreaks faced by his protagonists, Mahfouz exposes the hypocrisy of those who condemn any breach of sexual morality while turning a blind eye to violence, corruption, and oppression, double standards as applied to men's and women's sexuality, and the folly of an exclusive focus on sexual morals without reference to other aspects of human character.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd03b48685135a1d67ba.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5e5","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5e6","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5e7","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5e8","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5e9","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ea","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5eb","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ec","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ed","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ee","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f9","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c604","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c625","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c626","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c627","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c628","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c629","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c62f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c630","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c631","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c632","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c633","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c634","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c635","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c636","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c637","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c638","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c639","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c63f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c640","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c641","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c642","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c643","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c644","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c645","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c646","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c647","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c648","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c649","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c64f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c650","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c651","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c652","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c653","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c654","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c655","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c656","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c657","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c658","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c659","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c65f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c660","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c661","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c662","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c663","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c664","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c665","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c666","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c667","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c668","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c669","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c66f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c670","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c671","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c672","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c673","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c674","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c675","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c676","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c677","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c678","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c679","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ef","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f0","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f1","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f2","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f3","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f4","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f5","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f6","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f7","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5f8","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5fa","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5fb","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5fc","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5fd","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5fe","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c5ff","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c600","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c601","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c602","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c603","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c605","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c606","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c607","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c608","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c609","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60a","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c60e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c610","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c611","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c612","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c613","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c614","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c615","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c616","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c617","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c618","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c619","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61b","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61c","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61d","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61e","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c61f","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c620","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c621","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c622","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c623","5c29dd85b486852b17d9c624"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"雨中的爱"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["雨中的爱"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["Love in the Rain"]}}

In Khufu's Wisdom, translated by Raymond Stock, Pharaoh Khufu is battling the Fates. At stake is the inheritance of Egypt's throne, the proud but tender heart of Khufu's beautiful daughter Princess Meresankh, and Khufu's legacy as a sage, not savage, ruler. Rhadopis of Nubia, translated by Anthony Calderbank, follows the powerful love that grows between Rhadopis, a courtesan whose ravishing beauty is unmatched in time or place, and youthful, headstrong Pharaoh Merenra, worshiped by his people as a divine presence on earth, against the background of the high politics of Sixth Dynasty Egypt. Finally, in Thebes at War, translated by Humphrey Davies and written in 1937 - 1938 when Britain and Turkey held sway over Egypt, Mahfouz dramatically depicts the Egyptian people's undying loyalty to their land and religion and their refusal to bow to outside domination. After two hundred years of occupation, the Hyksos leader in his capital in northern Egypt tells Pharaoh in the south that the roaring of the sacred hippopotami at Thebes is keeping him awake at night and demands that they be killed, galvanizing Egypt into hurling its armies into a struggle to drive the barbarians from its sacred soil forever.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddfcb48685135a238e9f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.11,"goodreads_ratings":375,"level":3,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e8b8b486852b17de9b9b","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9b9c","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9b9d","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9b9e","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9b9f","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba5","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba6","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba7","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba8","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9ba9","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9baa","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bab","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bac","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bad","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bae","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9baf","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb5","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb6","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb7","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb8","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bb9","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bba","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bbb","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bbc","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bbd","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bbe","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bbf","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc5","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc6","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc7","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc8","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bc9","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bca","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bcb","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bcc","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bcd","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bce","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bcf","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd5","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd6","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd7","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd8","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bd9","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bda","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bdb","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bdc","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bdd","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bde","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bdf","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be5","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be6","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be7","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be8","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9be9","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bea","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9beb","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bec","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bed","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bee","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bef","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf0","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf1","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf2","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf3","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf4","5c29e8b8b486852b17de9bf5"],"year":"","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"古埃及王国的三部小说（胡夫的智慧，努比亚的拉比多，战争中的底比斯）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.11],"goodreads_ratings":[375],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["古埃及王国的三部小说（胡夫的智慧，努比亚的拉比多，战争中的底比斯）"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["Three Novels of Ancient Egypt (Khufu's Wisdom, Rhadopis of Nubia, Thebes at War)"]}}

He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name.

Controlling Accounts.--The addition of special columns in books of original entry makes possible the keeping of Controlling Accounts. The most common examples of such accounts are Accounts Receivable account and Accounts Payable account. These summary accounts, respectively, displace individual customers' and creditors' accounts in the Ledger. The customers' accounts are then segregated in another book called the Sales Ledger or Customers' Ledger, while the creditors' accounts are kept in the Purchase or Creditors' Ledger. The original Ledger, now much reduced in size, is called the General Ledger. The Trial Balance now refers to the accounts in the General Ledger. It is evident that the task of taking a Trial Balance is greatly simplified because so many fewer accounts are involved. A Schedule of Accounts Receivable is then prepared, consisting of the balances found in the Sales Ledger, and its total must agree with the balance of the Accounts Receivable account shown in the Trial Balance. A similar Schedule of Accounts Payable, made up of all the balances in the Purchase Ledger, is prepared, and it must agree with the balance of the Accounts Payable account of the General Ledger.\" The Balance Sheet.--In the more elementary part of the text, the student learned how to prepare a Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the purpose of disclosing the net capital of an enterprise.

They chronicle the vicissitudes of the leading members of a large commercial upper middle-class English family, similar to Galsworthy's own. The Man of Property is the first novel of the The Forsyte Saga. Soames Forsyte, a solicitor and &quot;man of property,&quot; is married to the beautiful, penniless Irene, who rebels against his values. In a short interlude Indian Summer of a Forsyte, Galsworthy delves into the newfound friendship between Irene and Old Jolyon Forsyte. In Chancery is the second novel of the Forsyte Saga trilogy, the subject is the marital discord of both Soames and his sister Winifred. The subject of the second interlude The Awakening is the naive and exuberant lifestyle of eight-year-old Jon Forsyte. To Let, the final novel of the Forsyte Saga, chronicles the continuing feuds of the two factions within the troubled Forsyte family.

On the platform within, Mr. Horace Pendyce's first footman and second groom in long livery coats with silver buttons, their appearance slightly relieved by the rakish cock of their top-hats, awaited the arrival of the 6.15. The first footman took from his pocket a half-sheet of stamped and crested notepaper covered with Mr. Horace Pendyce's small and precise calligraphy. He read from it in a nasal, derisive voice: &quot;Hon. Geoff, and Mrs. Winlow, blue room and dress; maid, small drab. Mr. George, white room. Mrs. Jaspar Bellew, gold. The Captain, red.

But they are also like all families, in that the stories they tell themselves reveal only part of the picture. Abby and Red and their four grown children have accumulated not only tender moments, laughter, and celebrations, but also jealousies, disappointments, and carefully guarded secrets. From Red's father and mother, newly arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to Abby and Red's grandchildren carrying the family legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century, here are four generations of Whitshanks, their lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn Baltimore house that has always been their anchor.

With his first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Michael Chabon announced his presence as a literary wunderkind of style and substance. A Model World and Other Stories only burnished his reputation as a distinctive prose stylist. In eleven elegant tales some of them linked by the New York Times bestselling author of Telegraph Avenue and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay , Chabon s singular characters hold tight to private dreams even as their closest relationships crumble. Five stories follow an anxious adolescent from the beach vacation where he learns of his parents divorce to the confused days of a woefully misguided crush. Others find ex-lovers tormenting each other at an oceanside caf , a washed-up professional baseball player attending a teammate s funeral, and a Pittsburgh disc jockey still pining for a woman who married him to get her American citizenship. Chabon moves across powerful emotional ground with certainty and delicacy, raves the Chicago Tribune . There are heartbreaking moments in these stories, but they are rendered so precisely, through incidents that capture the subtlest of feelings, that the reader can only smile at Chabon s skill. This ebook features a biography of the author.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de4ab48685135a255721.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.54,"goodreads_ratings":2807,"level":3,"publisher":"Open Road Integrated Media","segments":["5c29ebfdb486852b17e000d6","5c29ebfdb486852b17e000d7"],"year":"","zh_author":"米迦勒沙邦","zh_bookname":"模范世界和其他故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.54],"goodreads_ratings":[2807],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["模范世界和其他故事"],"author":["Michael Chabon"],"zh_author":["米迦勒沙邦"],"bookname":["A Model World and Other Stories"]}}

Unwisely but generously, Innokenty helps a friend in danger of arrest, only to be arrested himself and sent to a special prison. This, the archetype of the Gulag, is described with masterful psychological insight. There are no heroes and hardly any villains; oppressors are no less victims then the oppressed. In the great tradition of the Russian novel, The First Circle is both a brooding account of human nature and a scrupulously exact description of a historical period.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd3b48685135a2267d8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.2,"goodreads_ratings":6446,"level":2,"publisher":"Random House","segments":["5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6cd","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ce","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6cf","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d0","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d1","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d2","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d3","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d4","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d5","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d6","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d7","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d8","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6d9","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6da","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6db","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6dc","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6dd","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6de","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6df","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e0","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e1","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e2","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e3","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e4","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e5","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e6","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e7","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e8","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6e9","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ea","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6eb","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ec","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ed","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ee","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ef","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f0","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f1","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f2","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f3","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f4","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f5","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f6","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f7","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f8","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6f9","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6fa","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6fb","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6fc","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6fd","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6fe","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb6ff","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb700","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb701","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb702","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb703","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb704","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb705","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb706","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb707","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb708","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb709","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70a","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70b","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70c","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70d","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70e","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb70f","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb710","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb711","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb712","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb713","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb714","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb715","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb716","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb717","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb718","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb719","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71a","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71b","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71c","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71d","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71e","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb71f","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb720","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb721","5c29e6a4b486852b17ddb722"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"索尔仁尼琴","zh_bookname":"第一圈"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.2],"goodreads_ratings":[6446],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["第一圈"],"author":["Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"],"zh_author":["索尔仁尼琴"],"bookname":["First Circle"]}}

SERIES EDITED BY CYNTHIA BRANTLEY JOHNSON Review The New York Times A comment upon the meaning and tragedy of life as it is lived in any age in any quarter of the globe. Pittsburgh Post Gazette One of the most important and revealing novels of our time. Boston Transcript One need never have lived in China or know anything about the Chinese to understand it or respond to its appeal. About the Author Pearl Comfort Sydenstricker was born on June 26, 1892, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Her parents were Southern Presbyterian missionaries, most often stationed in China, and from childhood, Pearl spoke both English and Chinese. She returned to China shortly after graduation from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1914, and the following year, she met a young agricultural economist named John Lossing Buck. They married in 1917, and immediately moved to Nanhsuchou in rural Anhwei province. In this impoverished community, Pearl Buck gathered the material that she would later use in The Good Earth and other stories of China. Pearl began to publish stories and essays in the 1920s, in magazines such as The Nation, The Chinese Recorder, Asia, and The Atlantic Monthly. Her first novel, East Wind, West Wind, was published by the John Day Company in 1930. John Day's publisher, Richard Walsh, would eventually become Pearl's second husband, in 1935, after both received divorces. In 1931, John Day published Pearl's second novel, The Good Earth. This became the bestselling book of both 1931 and 1932, won the Pulitzer Prize and the Howells Medal in 1935, and would be adapted as a major MGM film in 1937. Other novels and books of nonfiction quickly followed. In 1938, less than a decade after her first book had appeared, Pearl won the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. By the time of her death in 1973, Pearl had published more than seventy books: novels, collections of stories, biography and autobiography, poetry, drama, children's literature, and translations from the Chinese. She is buried at Green Hills Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dddbb48685135a229dad.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.97,"goodreads_ratings":203064,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e6ffb486852b17dde278","5c29e6ffb486852b17dde279","5c29e6ffb486852b17dde27a","5c29e6ffb486852b17dde27b"],"year":"1933","zh_author":"赛珍珠","zh_bookname":"好地球"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.97],"goodreads_ratings":[203064],"year":["1933"],"zh_bookname":["好地球"],"author":["Pearl Buck"],"zh_author":["赛珍珠"],"bookname":["The Good Earth"]}}

William Golding s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies . For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Nor reader will soon forget the world it reveals.' Kingsley Amis Drowning in the freezing North Atlantic, Christopher Hadley Martin, temporary lieutenant, happens upon a grotesque rock, an island that appears only on weather charts. To drink there is a pool of rain water; to eat there are weeds and sea anemones. Through the long hours with only himself to talk to, Martin must try to assemble the truth of his fate, piece by terrible piece. From the author of Lord of the Flies, Pincher Martin is a terrifying and unforgettable journey into one man's mind. 'A work of genius.' Philippa Gregory 'Like a cold sweat, a day-mare, or going under gas ... Prose more tightly packed, more jaggedly concrete, I can't imagine; and the shock ending, which throws a new and doubly alarming retrospective light on the whole book, is technical wizardry of the first order.' Kenneth Tynan, Observer 'Remarkably sustained imaginative intensity.' TLS About the Author Born in Cornwall, England, William Golding started writing at the age of seven. Though he studied natural sciences at Oxford to please his parents, he also studied English and published his first book, a collection of poems, before finishing college. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II, participating in the Normandy invasion. Golding's other novels include Lord of the Flies, The Inheritors, The Spire, Rites of Passage (Booker Prize), and The Double Tongue.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de60b48685135a25f417.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.59,"goodreads_ratings":1513,"level":3,"publisher":"Harvest","segments":["5c29ed19b486852b17e07feb","5c29ed19b486852b17e07fec","5c29ed19b486852b17e07fed","5c29ed19b486852b17e07fee","5c29ed19b486852b17e07fef","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff0","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff1","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff2","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff3","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff4","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff5","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff6","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff7","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff8","5c29ed19b486852b17e07ff9"],"year":"1956","zh_author":"威廉戈尔丁","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"品彻 马丁"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.59],"goodreads_ratings":[1513],"year":["1956"],"zh_bookname":["品彻 马丁"],"author":["William Golding"],"zh_author":["威廉戈尔丁"],"bookname":["Pincher Martin"]}}

This edition, arranged by the author himself, includes the seminal early poetry that struck readers with the force of revelation and heralded the arrival of an heir to Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. B. Yeats, and Robert Frost. Helen Vendler called Heaney \"a poet of the in-between,\" and the work collected here dwells in the borderlands dividing the ancient and the contemporary, the mythic and the quotidian. Gathering poetry from his first seven collections, Selected Poems 1966-1987 presents the young man from County Derry, Northern Ireland, who \"emerged from a hidden, a buried life\" in Death of a Naturalist (1966), with his cherished poems \"Digging\" and \"Mid-term Break\"; the poet of conscience \"as bleak as he is bright\" in \"Whatever You Say Say Nothing\" and \"Singing School\"; and the astonishingly gifted, mature craftsman behind Field Work (1979) and Station Island (1984)-an artist uncannily attuned to the \"music of what happens,\" restlessly searching \"for images and symbols adequate to our predicament.\" This volume, together with its companion Selected Poems 1988-2013 , allows us to revisit the essential work of one of the great writers of our age through his own compilation.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de38b48685135a24d48e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.38,"goodreads_ratings":13,"level":5,"publisher":"Faber & Faber","segments":["5c29eafab486852b17df9005","5c29eafab486852b17df9006","5c29eafab486852b17df9007","5c29eafab486852b17df9008","5c29eafab486852b17df9009","5c29eafab486852b17df900a","5c29eafab486852b17df900b","5c29eafab486852b17df900c","5c29eafab486852b17df900d","5c29eafab486852b17df900e","5c29eafab486852b17df900f","5c29eafab486852b17df9010","5c29eafab486852b17df9011","5c29eafab486852b17df9012","5c29eafab486852b17df9013","5c29eafab486852b17df9014","5c29eafab486852b17df9015","5c29eafab486852b17df9016","5c29eafab486852b17df9017","5c29eafab486852b17df9018","5c29eafab486852b17df9019","5c29eafab486852b17df901a","5c29eafab486852b17df901b","5c29eafab486852b17df901c","5c29eafab486852b17df901d","5c29eafab486852b17df901e","5c29eafab486852b17df901f","5c29eafab486852b17df9020","5c29eafab486852b17df9021","5c29eafab486852b17df9022","5c29eafab486852b17df9023","5c29eafab486852b17df9024","5c29eafab486852b17df9025","5c29eafab486852b17df9026","5c29eafab486852b17df9027","5c29eafab486852b17df9028","5c29eafab486852b17df9029","5c29eafab486852b17df902a","5c29eafab486852b17df902b","5c29eafab486852b17df902c","5c29eafab486852b17df902d","5c29eafab486852b17df902e","5c29eafab486852b17df902f","5c29eafab486852b17df9030","5c29eafab486852b17df9031","5c29eafab486852b17df9032","5c29eafab486852b17df9033","5c29eafab486852b17df9034","5c29eafab486852b17df9035","5c29eafab486852b17df9036","5c29eafab486852b17df9037","5c29eafab486852b17df9038","5c29eafab486852b17df9039","5c29eafab486852b17df903a","5c29eafab486852b17df903b","5c29eafab486852b17df903c","5c29eafab486852b17df903d","5c29eafab486852b17df903e","5c29eafab486852b17df903f","5c29eafab486852b17df9040","5c29eafab486852b17df9041","5c29eafab486852b17df9042","5c29eafab486852b17df9043","5c29eafab486852b17df9044","5c29eafab486852b17df9045","5c29eafab486852b17df9046","5c29eafab486852b17df9047","5c29eafab486852b17df9048","5c29eafab486852b17df9049","5c29eafab486852b17df904a","5c29eafab486852b17df904b","5c29eafab486852b17df904c","5c29eafab486852b17df904d","5c29eafab486852b17df904e","5c29eafab486852b17df904f","5c29eafab486852b17df9050","5c29eafab486852b17df9051"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"谢默斯希尼","zh_bookname":"1966年至1987年新诗"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.38],"goodreads_ratings":[13],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["1966年至1987年新诗"],"author":["Seamus Heaney"],"zh_author":["谢默斯希尼"],"bookname":["New and Selected Poems 1966-1987"]}}

He is used to the way of horses, too; but nothing has prepared him for the special connection he will forge with Gabilan, the hot-tempered pony his father gives him. With Billy Buck, the hired hand, Jody tends and trains his horse, restlessly anticipating the moment he will sit high upon Gabilan's saddle. But when Gabilan falls ill, Jody discovers there are still lessons he must learn about the ways of nature and, particularly, the ways of man. Review Book of four related stories by John Steinbeck, published in 1937 and expanded in 1945. The stories chronicle a young boy's maturation. In ''The Gift,'' the best-known story, young Jody Tiflin is given a red pony by his rancher father. Under ranch hand Billy Buck's guidance, Jody learns to care for and train his pony, which he names Gabilan. Caught in an unexpected rain, Gabilan catches a cold and, despite Billy Buck's ministrations, dies. Jody watches the buzzards alight on the body of his beloved pony, and, distraught at his inability to control events, he kills one of them. The other stories in The Red Pony are ''The Great Mountains,'' ''The Promise,'' and ''The Leader of the People,'' in which Jody develops empathy and also learns from his grandfather about ''westering,'' the migration of people to new places and the urge for new experiences. __ Product Description Tells a story of a young boy and life on his father's California ranch, raising a sorrel colt.

He then pulls us forward in time to view the sexually active adult he has become, engaged in a series of difficult relationships, in constant trouble with the Chinese authorities, and in danger of being marked out as a 'counter-revolutionary'. The book moves between the nightmare of the Cultural Revolution insanities of the late 1960s and early 1970s to the tentative, limited liberations of the 1990s, and the narrator moves between China, Hong Kong, Paris and Frankfurt. Through it all throbs an overwhelmingly powerful sense of the past, distant and near, and a moving and unprecedented insight into the character of modern China. * Gao has his narrator say of the book's purpose: 'Your writing is not in the cause of pure literature, but you're also not a fighter using your pen as a weapon to promote right, moreover you don't know what's right. You know you're certainly not the embodiment of right and you write simply to indicate that a sort of life worse than a quagmire, more real than an imaginary hell, more terrifying than the judgement of the last day has existed. Furthermore, it's highly likely that after people have forgotten about it, it will make a comeback, and people who've never gone crazy will go crazy again, and people who've never been oppressed will oppress or be oppressed. This is because madness has existed since the birth of humanity.' ** <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde3b48685135a22dde3.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"numberOfReading":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e76bb486852b17de1294","5c29e76bb486852b17de1295","5c29e76bb486852b17de1296","5c29e76bb486852b17de1297","5c29e76bb486852b17de1298","5c29e76bb486852b17de1299","5c29e76bb486852b17de129a","5c29e76bb486852b17de129b","5c29e76bb486852b17de129c","5c29e76bb486852b17de129d","5c29e76bb486852b17de129e","5c29e76bb486852b17de129f","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a0","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a1","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a2","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a3","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a4","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a5","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a6","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a7","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a8","5c29e76bb486852b17de12a9","5c29e76bb486852b17de12aa","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ab","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ac","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ad","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ae","5c29e76bb486852b17de12af","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b0","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b1","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b2","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b3","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b4","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b5","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b6","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b7","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b8","5c29e76bb486852b17de12b9","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ba","5c29e76bb486852b17de12bb","5c29e76bb486852b17de12bc","5c29e76bb486852b17de12bd","5c29e76bb486852b17de12be","5c29e76bb486852b17de12bf","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c0","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c1","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c2","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c3","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c4","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c5","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c6","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c7","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c8","5c29e76bb486852b17de12c9","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ca","5c29e76bb486852b17de12cb","5c29e76bb486852b17de12cc","5c29e76bb486852b17de12cd","5c29e76bb486852b17de12ce","5c29e76bb486852b17de12cf","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d0","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d1","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d2","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d3","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d4","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d5","5c29e76bb486852b17de12d6"],"year":"1998","zh_author":"高行健","zh_bookname":"一个人的圣经"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1998"],"zh_bookname":["一个人的圣经"],"author":["Gao Xingjian"],"zh_author":["高行健"],"bookname":["One Man's Bible"]}}

With consummate skill, Mann draws a rounded picture of middle-class life: births and christenings; marriages, divorces, and deaths; successes and failures. These commonplace occurrences, intrinsically the same, vary slightly as they recur in each succeeding generation. Yet as the Buddenbrooks family eventually succumbs to the seductions of modernity -- seductions that are at variance with its own traditions -- its downfall becomes certain.In immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, Buddenbrooks surpasses all other modem family chronicles; it has, indeed, proved a model for most of them. Judged as the greatest of Mann's novels by some critics, it is ranked as among the greatest by all.

Woods s version . . . Woods captures perfectly the irony and humor. _New York Times Book Review _ [Woods s translation] succeeds in capturing the beautiful cadence of [Mann s] ironically elegant prose. _Washington Post Book World _ [_The Magic Mountain_] is one of those works that changed the shape and possibilities of European literature. It is a masterwork, unlike any other. It is also, if we learn to read it on its own terms, a delight, comic and profound, a new form of language, a new way of seeing. from the new Introduction by A. S. Byatt Product Description (Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) With this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Thomas Mann rose to the front ranks of the great modern novelists, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. The Magic Mountain takes place in an exclusive tuberculosis sanatorium in the Swiss Alps a community devoted to sickness that serves as a fictional microcosm for Europe in the days before the First World War. To this hermetic and otherworldly realm comes Hans Castorp, an ordinary young man who arrives for a short visit and ends up staying for seven years, during which he succumbs both to the lure of eros and to the intoxication of ideas. Acclaimed translator John E. Woods has given us the definitive English version of Mann s masterpiece. A monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension and intellectual ferment, The Magic Mountain is an enduring classic.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de46b48685135a253a9a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.14,"goodreads_ratings":28197,"level":3,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe840","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe841","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe842","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe843","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe844","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe845","5c29ebc5b486852b17dfe846"],"year":"2005","zh_author":"托马斯曼","zh_bookname":"魔法山"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.14],"goodreads_ratings":[28197],"year":["2005"],"zh_bookname":["魔法山"],"author":["Thomas Mann"],"zh_author":["托马斯曼"],"bookname":["The Magic Mountain"]}}

The children are very like the child Meridian was; the town is very like the one she was born in; town and children alike are part of something Meridian chose to leave when, in a spirit of idle curiosity, she volunteered to help the civil rights movement in her native town. Her story is a tally of the cost of following through the consequences of that decision. It involves not only a break with her upbringing and the desertion of her child, who was part of that upbringing, but also a break with three people who became enmeshed in the new life Meridian had chosen: Anne-Marion, her friend from college; Truman, her lover; and Lynne, Truman's wife. All three believe like Meridian, in the cause of civil rights; but in their different ways each is destroyed because they need a cause more than the cause needs them. The price Meridian pays buys, for her alone, a resolution that is neither desperation nor defeat. Alice Walker's achievement is to bring home to us the cost of commitment to a cause both to those who want to help and to those they try to serve; and to do this through characters whom their creator never has to manipulate because she has endowed them with all the complexity of real people who can, alas, manipulate themselves all to ably in the cause of tragedy.

I found myself unmoored, unmated, ungrounded in a way that challenged everything I'd ever thought about human relationships. Situated squarely in that terrifying paradise called freedom, precipitously out on so many emotional limbs, it was as if I had been born; and in fact I was being reborn as the woman I was to become.\" So says Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker about her beautiful new book, in which \"one of the best American writers today\" (The Washington Post) gives us superb stories based on rich truths from her own experience. Imbued with Walker's wise philosophy and understanding of people, the spirit, sex and love, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart begins with a lyrical, autobiographical story of a marriage set in the violent and volatile Deep South during the early years of the civil rights movement. Walker goes on to imagine stories that grew out of the life following that marriage a life, she writes, that was \"marked by deep sea-changes and transitions.\" These provocative stories showcase Walker's hard-won knowledge of love of many kinds and of the relationships that shape our lives, as well as her infectious sense of humor and joy. Filled with wonder at the power of the life force and of the capacity of human beings to move through love and loss and healing to love again, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart is an enriching, passionate book by \"a lavishly gifted writer\" (The New York Times Book Review). Amazon.com Review Even a fickle reader of Alice Walker will find something to admire in The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart . This tender, elegiac collection of stories is based in part on her early marriage to a white man and her continuing puzzlement at how their connection--once so charmed and resilient--faded to nothing. Looking back at their happy years together in \"the racially volatile and violent Deep South state of Mississippi,\" a place and time in which their union was not only unconventional but illegal, Walker is also led to imagine other, less metaphoric homecomings. After the initial autobiographical story, \"To My Young Husband,\" she turns to a character named Rosa, a novelist like herself, who returns home to the South with her sister, Barbara, after their grandfather's death. Rosa had not made it to the funeral, since news of his death arrived just as she was leaving on a long-planned holiday abroad. Now, belatedly, she has come to gather family stories. But when she asks her Aunt Lily a question, this woman glares back at her with something close to hatred: \"I don't want to find myself in anything you write. And you can just leave your daddy alone too.\" Reeling, Rosa turns to her sister for comfort, but Barbara, too, rejects her with \"a look that said she'd got the reply she'd deserved.\" For wasn't she always snooping about the family's business and turning things about in her writing in ways that made the family shudder? There was no talking to her as you talked to regular people. The minute you opened your mouth a meter went on. Rose could read all this on her sister's face. She didn't need to speak. And it was a lonely feeling that she had. For Barbara was right. Aunt Lily too. And she could no more stop the meter running than she could stop her breath. With her characteristic insight and her slow, colloquial prose--seeded with anger but watered with hope--Walker explores the territory of her own broken heart and those of African Americans of her generation. --Regina Marler From Publishers Weekly HIn 13 affectionate stories, Walker (The Color Purple; By the Light of My Father's Smile) reflects on the nature of passion and friendship, pondering the emotional trajectories of lives and loves. Some of the pieces are directly autobiographical, as Walker explains in her preface. \"To My Young Husband\" is about her marriage as a young woman to a Jewish civil rights lawyer and their difficult but mostly happy decade in Mississippi and Brooklyn. Many years later, telling her daughter the story of the marriage, Walker wonders how she and her ex-husband, once so close, could have become such strangers. Other stories are \"mostly fiction, but with a definite thread of having come out of a singular life.\" Old hurts are soothed in \"Olive Oil,\" in which Orelia learns to trust her husband, John, and not visit the sins of the past upon him. In \"The Brotherhood of the Saved,\" Hannah, the lesbian narrator, confronts the bigotry of religion and attempts to save her relationship with her mother, whose fundamentalist church is urging her to ostracize her daughter. A trip to a screening of Deep Throat gets the older woman and two of her friends talking about sex, but true acceptance proves more elusive. Infusing her intimate tales with grace and humor, Walker probes hidden corners of the human experience, at once questioning and acknowledging sexual, racial and cultural rifts. Though a few stories tip into self-indulgence and read less like fiction than personal testimony, this is nonetheless a strong, moving collection. A common theme runs throughoutDwe are all obliged to love and be loved, no matter how blind, inexpert or troublesome we may be. 100,000 first printing; 8-city author tour. (Oct.)

As villagers begin, one by one, to die, the rest face a choice: do they flee their village in hope of outrunning the plague or do they stay? The lord of the manor and his family pack up and leave. The rector, Michael Mompellion, argues forcefully that the villagers should stay put, isolate themselves from neighboring towns and villages, and prevent the contagion from spreading. His oratory wins the day and the village turns in on itself. Cocooned from the outside world and ravaged by the disease, its inhabitants struggle to retain their humanity in the face of the disaster. The narrator, the young widow Anna Frith, is one of the few who succeeds. With Mompellion and his wife, Elinor, she tends to the dying and battles to prevent her fellow villagers from descending into drink, violence, and superstition. All is complicated by the intense, inexpressible feelings she develops for both the rector and his wife. Year of Wonders sometimes seems anachronistic as historical fiction; Anna and Mompellion occasionally appear to be modern sensibilities unaccountably transferred to 17th-century Derbyshire. However, there is no mistaking the power of Brooks's imagination or the skill with which she constructs her story of ordinary people struggling to cope with extraordinary circumstances. --Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk From Publishers Weekly Discriminating readers who view the term historical novel with disdain will find that this debut by praised journalist Brooks (Foreign Correspondence) is to conventional work in the genre as a diamond is to a rhinestone. With an intensely observant eye, a rigorous regard for period detail, and assured, elegant prose, Brooks re-creates a year in the life of a remote British village decimated by the bubonic plague. Inspired by the actual town commemorated as Plague Village because of the events that transpired there in 1665-1666, Brooks tells her harrowing story from the perspective of 18-year-old Anna Frith, a widow with two young sons. Anna works as a maid for vicar Michael Mompellion and his gentle, selfless wife, Elinor, who has taught her to read. When bubonic plague arrives in the community, the vicar announces it as a scourge sent by God; obeying his command, the villagers voluntarily seal themselves off from the rest of the world. The vicar behaves nobly as he succors his dwindling flock, and his wife, aided by Anna, uses herbs to alleviate their pain. As deaths mount, however, grief and superstition evoke mob violence against \"witches,\" and cults of self-flagellation and devil worship. With the facility of a prose artist, Brooks unflinchingly describes barbaric 17th-century customs and depicts the fabric of life in a poor rural area. If Anna's existential questions about the role of religion and ethical behavior in a world governed by nature seem a bit too sophisticated for her time, Brooks keeps readers glued through starkly dramatic episodes and a haunting story of flawed, despairing human beings. This poignant and powerful account carries the pulsing beat of a sensitive imagination and the challenge of moral complexity. (Aug. 6)Forecast: Brooks should be a natural on talk shows as she tells of discovering the town of Eyam, in Derbyshire, in 1990, and her research to unearth its remarkable history. With astute marketing, Viking will have a winner here.

A world where fathers fly in clouds of rose petals, and women can cast spells. The text is perfectly suited for an audio rendition - as poetry, songs and the spoken word feature so heavily in the book. Morrison narrates for three hours and lays out before us the complex lives and backgrounds of four generations of black family life in the south. Central is the character Milkman--an unfortunate nickname owed to his lengthy nursing period and delayed coming of age. Although a late starter, Milkman develops into a fundamentally strong person, who eventually learns to cherish his family and the importance of his roots. The narrator breathes life into an intriguing and diverse set of characters--from violent criminals to devout parents. Through them Morrison explores complex social and racial issues using luscious lyrical language This text refers to the audiobook edition of this title. Review A rich, full novel. . . . It lifts us up [and] impresses itself upon us like a love affair. _The New York Times Book Review _ Exuberant. . . . An artistic vision that encompasses both a private and national heritage. A rhapsodic work. . . . Intricate and inventive. _The New Yorker Stunningly beautiful. . . . Full of magnificent people. . . . They are still haunting my house. I suspect they will be with me forever. Anne Tyler, The Washington Post _ If Ralph Ellison s Invisible Man went underground, Toni Morrison s Milkman flies. John Leonard, _The New York Times Book Review It places Toni Morrison in the front rank of contemporary American writers. She has written a novel that will endure. The Washington Post Lovely. . . . A delight, full of lyrical variety and allusiveness. . . . [An] exceptionally diverse novel. The Atlantic Monthly Morrison is a terrific storyteller. . . . Her writing evokes the joyful richness of life. Newsday Morrison dazzles. . . . She creates a black community strangely unto itself yet never out of touch with the white world. . . . With an ear as sharp as glass she has listened to the music of black talk and uses it as a palette knife to create black lives and to provide some of the best fictional dialogue around today. The Nation A marvelous novel, the most moving I have read in ten years of reviewing. Cleveland Plain Dealer Toni Morrison has created a fanciful world here. . . . She has an impeccable sense of emotional detail. She s the most sensible lyrical writer around today. The Philadelphia Inquirer A fine novel exuberantly constructed. . . . So rich in its use of common speech, so sophisticated in its use of literary traditions and language from the Bible to Faulkner . . . it is also extremely funny. The Hudson Review Toni Morrison is an extraordinarily good writer. Two pages into anything she writes one feels the power of her language and the emotional authority behind that language. . . . One closes the book warmed through by the richness of its sympathy, and by its breathtaking feel for the nature of sexual sorrow. The Village Voice Morrison moves easily in and out of the lives and thoughts of her characters, luxuriating in the diversity of circumstances and personality, and revelling in the sound of their voices and of her own, which echoes and elaborates theirs.

Even before we speak to someone in a meeting, at a party, or on the street, our clothes often express important information (or misinformation) about our occupation, origin, personality, opinions, and tastes. And we pay close attention to how others dress as well; though we may not be able to put what we observe into words, we unconsciously register the information, so that when we meet and converse we have already spoken to one another in a universal tongue. Alison Lurie, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, is our savvy guide and interpreter on this tour through the history of fashion. She provides fascinating insights into how changing sex roles, political upheavals, and class structure have influenced costume. Whether she is describing the enormous amount of clothing worn by early Victorian women or illuminating the significance of the long robes worn by aging men throughout history to connote eminence, her analysis is playful, clever, and always on target.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de3cb48685135a24edb3.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.61,"goodreads_ratings":162,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d3","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d4","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d5","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d6","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d7","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d8","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7d9","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7da","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7db","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7dc","5c29eb2bb486852b17dfa7dd"],"year":"","zh_author":"艾莉森 卢里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"服装语言"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.61],"goodreads_ratings":[162],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["服装语言"],"author":["Alison Lurie"],"zh_author":["艾莉森 卢里"],"bookname":["The Language of Clothes"]}}

Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. 1 As I walked by myself And talked to myself, Myself said unto me, Look to thyself, Take care of thyself, For nobody cares for thee. Old Song On a cold blowy February day a woman is boarding the ten a.m. flight to London, followed by an invisible dog. The womans name is Virginia Miner: she is fifty-four years old, small, plain, and unmarriedthe sort of person that no one ever notices, though she is an Ivy League college professor who has published several books and has a well-established reputation in the expanding field of childrens literature. The dog that is trailing Vinnie, visible only to her imagination, is her familiar demon or demon familiar, known to her privately as Fido and representing self-pity. She visualizes him as a medium-sized dirty-white long-haired mutt, mainly Welsh terrier: sometimes trailing her silently, at other times whining and panting and nipping at her heels; when bolder, dashing round in circles trying to trip her up, or at least get her to stoop down so that he may rush at her, knock her to the ground, and cover her with sloppy kisses. Vinnie knows very well that Fido wants to get onto the plane with her, but she hopes to leave him behind, as she has successfully done on other trips abroad. Recent events, however, and the projected length of her stay, make this unlikely. Vinnie is leaving today for six months in England on a foundation grant. There, under her professional name of V. A. Miner, she will continue her study of the folk-rhymes of schoolchildren. She has made this journey a number of times, and through a process of trial and error reduced its expense and discomfort to a minimum. She always chooses a daytime charter flight, preferring those on which no films are shown. If she could afford it, she would pay the regular fare so as to avoid boarding delays (she has already stood in various lines for nearly an hour); but that would be foolishly extravagant. Her grant is small, and she will have to watch expenses carefully as it is. Though patience is held to be a virtue most appropriate to women, especially aging women, Vinnie has always particularly disliked waiting for anything, and never does so if it can be avoided. Now, for instance, she elbows her way deftly past less experienced passengers who are searching for their seat numbers or are encumbered with excess luggage or with children, excusing herself in a thin pleasant voice. By crossing through the galley to the far aisle and back again between two rows of seats, she outflanks a massed confusion of obvious rubes with carry-on bags labeled sun tours. In less time than it takes to read this paragraph she has made her way to a window seat near an exit in the nonsmoking section, pausing only to extract the London Times and British Vogue from a magazine rack. (Once the plane is airborne, the stewardess will distribute periodicals to all the passengers, but those Vinnie prefers may vanish before they reach her.) Following her usual procedure, Vinnie slides into her place and unzips her boots. In stocking feet she climbs onto the seat and opens the overhead locker; since she is barely over five feet tall, this is the only way she can reach it. She removes two pillows and a loose-woven blue blanket, which she drops onto the center seat beside her handbag and her British periodicals, thus tacitly claiming this space ifas is likely in midweek and mid-Februaryit hasnt been assigned to anyone. Then she arranges her worn wool-lined raincoat, her floppy beige felt hat, and her amber-and-beige Liberty-print wool shawl in the locker, in such a way that only the rudest of fellow passengers will attempt to encroach upon them. She slams the locker shut with some difficulty, and sits down. She stows her boots under her own seat along with a carton of duty-free Bristol Cream sherry, and puts on a pair of folding slippers. She arranges one pillow beside her head and wedges the other between her hip and the arm of the chair. Finally she smooths her crisply cut graying hair, leans back, and with a sigh fastens the seatbelt across her tan wool sweater and skirt. A disinterested observer, Vinnie is quite aware, might well consider these maneuvers and condemn her as self-concerned and grasping. In this culture, where energy and egotism are rewarded in the young and good-looking, plain aging women are supposed to be self-effacing, uncomplainingto take up as little space and breathe as little air as possible. All very well, she thinks, if you travel with someone dear to you or at least familiar: someone who will help you stow away your coat, tuck a pillow behind your head, find you a newspaperor if you choose, converse with you. But what of those who travel alone? Why should Vinnie Miner, whose comfort has been disregarded by others for most of her adult life, disregard her own comfort? Why should she allow her coat, hat, and belongings to be crushed by the coats and hats and belongings of younger, larger, handsomer persons? Why should she sit alone for seven or eight hours, pillowless and chilled, reading an outdated copy of Punch, with her feet swollen and her pale amber eyes watering from the smoke of the cigarette fiends in the adjoining seats? As she often says to herselfthough never aloud, for she knows how unpleasant it would soundwhy shouldnt she look out for herself? Nobody else will. But such internal arguments, frequent as they are with Vinnie, occupy little of her mind now. The uneven, uncharacteristically loud sigh she gave as she sank back against the scratchy blue plush was not a sigh of contentment, or even one of relief: it was an exhalation of wretchedness. Her travel routine has been performed by rote; if she were alone, she would break into wails of misery and vexation, and stain the London Times with her tears. Twenty minutes ago, while waiting in the departure lounge in a cheerful mood, Vinnie read in a magazine of national circulation a scornful and disparaging reference to her lifes work. Projects such as hers, the article stated, are a prime example of the waste of public funds, the proliferation of petty and useless scholarship, and the general weakness and folly of the humanities in America today. Do we really need a scholarly study of playground doggerel? inquired the writer, one L. D. Zimmern, a professor of English at Columbia. No doubt Mr. or Ms. Miner would answer this query by assuring us of the social, historical, or literary value of Ring-around-a-rosy, he continued, sawing through the supports of any possible answer; but he, for one, was not convinced. What makes this unprovoked attack especially hideous is that for over thirty years the Atlantic has been Vinnies favorite magazine. Though she was raised in the suburbs of New York and teaches at an upstate university, her imaginative loyalties are to New England. She has often thought that American culture took a long downward step when its hegemony passed from Boston to New York in the late nineteenth century; and it has been a comfort to her that the Atlantic continues to be edited from Back Bay. When she pictures her work receiving general public recognition, it is to this magazine that she awards the honor of discovery. She has fantasized the process often: the initial letter of inquiry, the respectfully eager manner of the interviewer, the title of the finished essay; the moment when her colleagues at Corinth University and elsewhere will open the magazine and see her name printed on its glossy pages in its characteristic and elegant typeface. (Vinnies ambition, though steady and ardent, is comparatively modest: it hasnt occurred to her that her name might be printed upon the cover of the Atlantic.) She has imagined all that will follow: the sudden delighted smiles of her friends; the graceless grins of those who are not her friends and have undervalued both her and her subject. The latter group, alas, will be much more numerous. For the truth is that childrens literature is a poor relation in her departmentindeed, in most English departments: a stepdaughter grudgingly tolerated because, as in the old tales, her words are glittering jewels of a sort that attract large if not equally brilliant masses of undergraduates. Within the departmental family she sits in the chimney-corner, while her idle, ugly siblings dine at the chairmans tablethough, to judge by enrollment figures, many of them must spout toads and lizards. Well, Vinnie thinks bitterly, now she has got her wish; her work has been mentioned in the Atlantic. Just her luckbecause surely there were others whose project titles might have attracted the spiteful attention of L. D. Zimmern. But of course it was she he chose, what else could she expect? Vinnie realizes that Fido has followed her onto the plane and is snuffling at her legs, but she lacks the energy to push him away. Above her seat the warning light has been turned on; the engines begin to vibrate as if with her own internal tremor. Vinnie stares through the streaked, distorting oblong of glass at gray tarmac, pitted heaps of dirty congealed snow, other planes taxiing toward takeoff; but what she sees is a crowd of Atlantic magazines queuing for departure or already en route, singly or in squadrons, flying over the United States in the hands and briefcases of travelers, hitching their way in automobiles, loaded onto trucks and trains, bundled and tied for sale on newsstands. She visualizes what must come or has already come of this mass migration: she sees, all over the countryin homes and offices, in libraries and dentists waiting roomsher colleagues, ex-colleagues, students, ex-students, neighbors, ex-neighbors, friends, and ex-friends (not to mention the me...","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de44b48685135a252812.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.74,"goodreads_ratings":8035,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a1","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a2","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a3","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a4","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a5","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a6","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a7","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a8","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9a9","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9aa","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9ab","5c29eba2b486852b17dfd9ac"],"year":"1994","zh_author":"艾莉森 卢里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"外交事务"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.74],"goodreads_ratings":[8035],"year":["1994"],"zh_bookname":["外交事务"],"author":["Alison Lurie"],"zh_author":["艾莉森 卢里"],"bookname":["Foreign Affairs"]}}

Lawrence Wright s remarkable book is based on five years of research and hundreds of interviews that he conducted in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, England, France, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The Looming Tower achieves an unprecedented level of intimacy and insight by telling the story through the interweaving lives of four men: the two leaders of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri; the FBI s counterterrorism chief, John O Neill; and the former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Faisal. As these lives unfold, we see revealed: the crosscurrents of modern Islam that helped to radicalize Zawahiri and bin Laden . . . the birth of al-Qaeda and its unsteady development into an organization capable of the American embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the attack on the USS Cole . . . O Neill s heroic efforts to track al-Qaeda before 9/11, and his tragic death in the World Trade towers . . . Prince Turki s transformation from bin Laden s ally to his enemy . . . the failures of the FBI, CIA, and NSA to share intelligence that might have prevented the 9/11 attacks. The Looming Tower broadens and deepens our knowledge of these signal events by taking us behind the scenes. Here is Sayyid Qutb, founder of the modern Islamist movement, lonely and despairing as he meets Western culture up close in 1940s America; the privileged childhoods of bin Laden and Zawahiri; family life in the al-Qaeda compounds of Sudan and Afghanistan; O Neill s high-wire act in balancing his all-consuming career with his equally entangling personal life--he was living with three women, each of them unaware of the others existence--and the nitty-gritty of turf battles among U.S. intelligence agencies. Brilliantly conceived and written, The Looming Tower draws all elements of the story into a galvanizing narrative that adds immeasurably to our understanding of how we arrived at September 11, 2001. The richness of its new information, and the depth of its perceptions, can help us deal more wisely and effectively with the continuing terrorist threat.

He takes great delight in hurting the animals in his family farm. Nils captures a tomte in a net while his family is at church and have left him home to memorize chapters from the Bible. The tomte proposes to Nils that if Nils frees him, the tomte will give him a huge gold coin. Nils rejects the offer and the tomte turns Nils into a tomte, which leaves him shrunken and able to talk with animals, who are thrilled to see the boy reduced to their size and are angry and hungry for revenge. While this is happening, wild geese are flying over the farm on one of their migrations, and a white farm goose attempts to join the wild ones. In an attempt to salvage something before his family returns, Nils holds on to the bird's neck as it successfully takes off and joins the wild birds. The wild geese, who are not pleased at all to be joined by a boy and a domestic goose, eventually take him on an adventurous trip across all the historical provinces of Sweden observing in passing their natural characteristics and economic resources. At the same time the characters and situations he encounters make him a man: the domestic goose needs to prove his ability to fly like the experienced wild geese, and Nils needs to prove to the geese that he would be a useful companion, despite their initial misgivings. During the trip, Nils learns that if he proves he has changed for the better, the tomte might be disposed to change him back to his normal size. The book also includes various subplots, concerning people whose lives are touched in one way or another by Nils and the wild geese. For example, one chapter centers on a young provincial man who feels lonely and alienated in the capital Stockholm, is befriended by a nice old gentleman who tells him (and the reader) about the city's history - and only later finds that it was none other than the King of Sweden, walking incognito in the park.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dda2b48685135a218880.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.04,"goodreads_ratings":8215,"level":2,"likeNum":1,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e52fb486852b17dd05ed","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05ee","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05ef","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f0","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f1","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f2","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f3","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f4","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f5","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f6","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f7","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f8","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05f9","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05fa","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05fb","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05fc","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05fd","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05fe","5c29e52fb486852b17dd05ff","5c29e52fb486852b17dd0600","5c29e52fb486852b17dd0601","5c29e52fb486852b17dd0602"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"瑞典作家拉格勒夫","zh_bookname":"Nils Holgersson的奇遇"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.04],"goodreads_ratings":[8215],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["Nils Holgersson的奇遇"],"author":["Selma Lagerlof"],"zh_author":["瑞典作家拉格勒夫"],"bookname":["The Wonderful Adventures of Nils Holgersson"]}}

But the students of Hailsham, an elite school in the English countryside, are so special that visitors shun them, and only by rumor and the occasional fleeting remark by a teacher do they discover their unconventional origins and strange destiny. Kazuo Ishiguro's sixth novel, Never Let Me Go , is a masterpiece of indirection. Like the students of Hailsham, readers are \"told but not told\" what is going on and should be allowed to discover the secrets of Hailsham and the truth about these children on their own. Offsetting the bizarreness of these revelations is the placid, measured voice of the narrator, Kathy H., a 31-year-old Hailsham alumna who, at the close of the 1990s, is consciously ending one phase of her life and beginning another. She is in a reflective mood, and recounts not only her childhood memories, but her quest in adulthood to find out more about Hailsham and the idealistic women who ran it. Although often poignant, Kathy's matter-of-fact narration blunts the sharper emotional effects you might expect in a novel that deals with illness, self-sacrifice, and the severe restriction of personal freedoms. As in Ishiguro's best-known work, The Remains of the Day , only after closing the book do you absorb the magnitude of what his characters endure. --Regina Marler From School Library Journal Adult/High School The elegance of Ishiguro's prose and the pitch-perfect voice of his narrator conspire to usher readers convincingly into the remembered world of Hailsham, a British boarding school for special students. The reminiscence is told from the point of view of Kathy H., now 31, whose evocation of the sheltered estate's sunlit rolling hills, guardians, dormitories, and sports pavilions is imbued with undercurrents of muted tension and foreboding that presage a darker reality. As an adult, Kathy re-engages in lapsed friendships with classmates Ruth and Tommy, examining the details of their shared youth and revisiting with growing awareness the clues and anecdotal evidence apparent to them even as youngsters that they were different from everyone outside. [...] Ishiguro conveys with exquisite sensitivity the emotional texture of the threesome's relationship, their bonds of personal loyalty that overcome fractures of trust, the palpable boundaries of hope, and the human capacity for forgiveness. Highly recommended for literary merit and as an exceptional platform for the discussion of a controversial topic.

But, at least, the wars that once ravaged the country have ceased. Axl and Beatrice, a couple of elderly Britons, decide that now is the time, finally, for them to set off across this troubled land of mist and rain to find the son they have not seen for years, the son they can scarcely remember. They know they will face many hazards--some strange and otherworldly--but they cannot foresee how their journey will reveal to them the dark and forgotten corners of their love for each other. Nor can they foresee that they will be joined on their journey by a Saxon warrior, his orphan charge, and a knight--each of them, like Axl and Beatrice, lost in some way to his own past, but drawn inexorably toward the comfort, and the burden, of the fullness of a life's memories.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd87b48685135a20b58c.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.46,"goodreads_ratings":50100,"level":2,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab4","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab5","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab6","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab7","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab8","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ab9","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6aba","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6abb","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6abc","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6abd","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6abe","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6abf","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ac0","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ac1","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ac2","5c29e3b8b486852b17dc6ac3"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"喀左石岛","zh_bookname":"埋葬巨人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.46],"goodreads_ratings":[50100],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["埋葬巨人"],"author":["Kazuo Ishiguro"],"zh_author":["喀左石岛"],"bookname":["The Buried Giant"]}}

In the first story a young wife and mother receives release from the unbearable pain of losing her three children from a most surprising source. In another, a young woman, in the aftermath of an unusual and humiliating seduction, reacts in a clever if less-than-admirable fashion. Other stories uncover the 'deep-holes' in a marriage, the unsuspected cruelty of children, and how a boy's disfigured face provides both the good things in his life and the bad. And in the long title story, we accompany Sophia Kovalevsky - a late-nineteenth-century Russian migr and mathematician - on a winter journey that takes her from the Riviera, where she visits her lover, to Paris, Germany, and, Denmark, where she has a fateful meeting with a local doctor, and finally to Sweden, where she teaches at the only university in Europe willing to employ a female mathematician. With clarity and ease, Alice Munro once again renders complex, difficult events and emotions into stories that shed light on the unpredictable ways in which men and women accommodate and often transcend what happens in their lives. Too Much Happiness is a compelling, provocative - even daring - collection.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd17b48685135a1df175.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.82,"goodreads_ratings":16140,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae3","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae4","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae5","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae6","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae7","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae8","5c29de8fb486852b17da2ae9","5c29de8fb486852b17da2aea"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"爱丽丝蒙罗","zh_bookname":"过多的幸福"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.82],"goodreads_ratings":[16140],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["过多的幸福"],"author":["Alice Munro"],"zh_author":["爱丽丝蒙罗"],"bookname":["Too Much Happiness"]}}

Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd4fb48685135a1f8190.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4,"goodreads_ratings":8931,"level":2,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Vintage","segments":["5c29e176b486852b17db6bfa","5c29e176b486852b17db6bfb","5c29e176b486852b17db6bfc","5c29e176b486852b17db6bfd","5c29e176b486852b17db6bfe","5c29e176b486852b17db6bff","5c29e176b486852b17db6c00","5c29e176b486852b17db6c01","5c29e176b486852b17db6c02","5c29e176b486852b17db6c03","5c29e176b486852b17db6c04","5c29e176b486852b17db6c05","5c29e176b486852b17db6c06","5c29e176b486852b17db6c07","5c29e176b486852b17db6c08","5c29e176b486852b17db6c09","5c29e176b486852b17db6c0a","5c29e176b486852b17db6c0b"],"year":"1970","zh_author":"爱丽丝蒙罗","zh_bookname":"女孩和女人的生活"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4],"goodreads_ratings":[8931],"year":["1970"],"zh_bookname":["女孩和女人的生活"],"author":["Alice Munro"],"zh_author":["爱丽丝蒙罗"],"bookname":["Lives of Girls and Women"]}}

Edith Wharton ( born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 - August 11, 1937) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, short story writer, and designer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930. Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight.

Wharton was born to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander in New York City. She had two brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. The saying \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families.

While rarely (after early youth) her primary focus, it always served her as a medium for recording the most vivid impressions and emotions, an intimate journal of longings and regrets. \"Poetry was important to Wharton,\" writes editor Louis Auchincloss, \"because it enabled her to express the deeply emotional side of her nature that she kept under such tight control, not only in her life but in the ordered sweep of her fiction.\" In later years her poetry also engaged with the public passions of wartime, as she found herself involved with the plight of Allied soldiers in France.

Other fields stretched away on our right and left to a border of woodland and a village steeple. All around was noonday quiet, and the sober disciplined landscape which the traveller's memory is apt to evoke as distinctively French. Sometimes, even to accustomed eyes, these ruled-off fields and compact grey villages seem merely flat and tame; at other moments the sensitive imagination sees in every thrifty sod and even furrow the ceaseless vigilant attachment of generations faithful to the soil. The particular bit of landscape before us spoke in all its lines of that attachment. The air seemed full of the long murmur of human effort, the rhythm of oft-repeated tasks, the serenity of the scene smiled away the war rumours which had hung on us since morning.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de32b48685135a24b3e2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eab0b486852b17df759f","5c29eab0b486852b17df75a0","5c29eab0b486852b17df75a1","5c29eab0b486852b17df75a2","5c29eab0b486852b17df75a3"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"战斗法国，从敦克尔到贝尔福"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["战斗法国，从敦克尔到贝尔福"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["Fighting France, From Dunkerke To Belfort"]}}

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics : All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Hailed as a Tolstoy with jokes by one critic, George Bernard Shaw was the most significant British playwright since the seventeenth century. Pygmalion persists as his best-loved play, one made into both a classic film which won Shaw an Academy Award for best screenplay and the perennially popular musical My Fair Lady . Pygmalion follows the adventures of phonetics professor Henry Higgins as he attempts to transform cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a refined lady. The scene in which Eliza appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most of Shaw s work, Pygmalion wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality, and an innate understanding of human relationships. This volume also includes Major Barbara , which attacks both capitalism and charitable organizations, The Doctor s Dilemma , a keen-eyed examination of medical morals and malpractice, and Heartbreak House , which exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I. John A. Bertolini is Ellis Professor of the Liberal Arts at Middlebury College, where he teaches dramatic literature, Shakespeare, and film. He has written The Playwrighting Self of Bernard Shaw and articles on Hitchcock, and British and American dramatists. Bertolini also wrote the introduction and notes to the Barnes & Noble Classics edition of Shaw s Man and Superman and Three Other Plays . Excerpt. Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. From John A. Bertolini's Introduction to *Pygmalion and Three Other Plays * When St. John Ervine, a fellow playwright and future biographer of Shaw, was wounded by a shell and had to have a leg amputated, Shaw wrote to cheer him up. First he recounted to Ervine how he, Shaw, had once broken a leg and had to get around on crutches but found that he could do without his \"leg just as easily as without eyes in the back of my head.\" Shaw then asserted that Ervine was actually better off than he himself was: \"You will be in a stronger position. I had to feed and nurse the useless leg. You will have all the energy you hitherto spent on it to invest in the rest of your frame. For a man of your profession two legs are an extravagance.\" Shaw went on to enumerate other benefits to losing the leg, such as an increased pension, and no more going to the Front. Finally Shaw reached the logical conclusion: \"The more the case is gone into the more it appears that you are an exceptionally happy and fortunate man, relieved of a limb to which you owed none of your fame, and which indeed was the cause of your conscription\" ( Collected Letters , vol. 3, pp. 550-501). Wit does not usually seem a humane weapon, but such a letter shows the same kind of comic courage Aristophanes exhibited when he condemned war by imagining women on a sex strike. Heartbreak House was written in a context where one could consider writing such a letter, and the play's mixed tones show it. Shaw claimed that the play wrote itself. By turns whimsical, farcical, melancholy, tragi-comic, and visionary, Heartbreak House sometimes drifts and sometimes sails full speed ahead whithersoever. Shaw said that it represented the European elite before the war by which he meant the people whose concerns should have been history, political economy, and government, but were instead sex, aesthetics, leisure activities, and money, and so people who let their countries blunder into war. Shaw arranges for various representative members of this society to gather for a weekend in the country in ancient Captain Shotover's house, which is designed to resemble a ship and therefore carries the metaphoric suggestion that it is the Ship of State. (People have been misled by Shaw's subtitle, \"A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes,\" to see a strong resemblance to Chekhov's plays, but Heartbreak House is at least equally indebted to Tolstoy's The Fruits of Enlightenment or Gorky's The Lower Depths .) Shaw claimed repeatedly that he did not know what his play meant, and indeed it is full of mystery. The play is launched with a young woman falling asleep while reading Othello , so that the rest of the play seems to be her dream, a bed-voyage. It begins and ends respectively with the averting of a small and a large destruction. In between, identities become confused and fluid as in dreams. The Captain insists on mistaking Mazzini Dunn for his old boatswain, Billy Dunn, though they do not look alike, and when the real Billy shows up unexpectedly, Shotover asks him, \"Are there two of you?\" and gets one of the play's biggest laughs (in a play that has fewer laughs than almost any other of Shaw's plays). Billy explains to his Captain the confusion by noting that there were two branches of the Dunn family, the drinking Dunns and the thinking Dunns. Captain Shotover as an inventor, adventurer, and architect succeeds Ridgeon and Higgins as a figure for the artist, but an artist who has gone slightly mad from disappointment with reality, whose heart was broken when his daughter rejected his ways and left home, and who himself has taken refuge in rum. To fill the void made by his daughter's desertion, he enters into a spiritual marriage with young Ellie Dunn, who had been in actuality planning herself to marry an older man, the crude capitalist Alfred Mangan. In that way, Shotover continues in the Shavian/Shakespearean line of spiritual affinities between fathers and daughters. In Major Barbara , Cusins says to Undershaft: \"A father's love for a grown-up daughter is the most dangerous of all infatuations. I apologize for mentioning my own pale, coy, mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it\". Like Undershaft, too, Shotover invents and keeps explosives. To the play's contemporaries who lived through the World War I, Heartbreak House , however indirectly, expressed the feelings of sadness, futility, and madness the war provoked (T. E. Lawrence, known as Lawrence of Arabia, who became a great friend of Shaw, called it \"the most blazing bit of genius in English literature\"). The play never alludes explicitly to the context of the war, though. The closest it comes to doing so is at the end, when a zeppelin flies over the house during an air raid and bombs are dropped. The ghostly inhabitants of Heartbreak House are variously terrified and thrilled by the energy, sound, and destructive power of the air machines. At the end, Captain Shotover calls the raid Judgment Day, while the heroines, Ellie Dunn and Hesione Hushabye, hope that the zeppelin will return the next night. Does Shaw mean that these people, the failed leaders of the best society, are played out and long only for the world to be destroyed? Or is their thrilling to the wonder and raw energy of the sky machine a sign of their renewal? Their purgation? (Shaw had always bet on young women, like Ellie, to become \"active verbs\" and change the world.)","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd2ab48685135a1e8724.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.02,"goodreads_ratings":17287,"level":3,"publisher":"Spark Educational Publishing","segments":["5c29df98b486852b17daa424","5c29df98b486852b17daa425","5c29df98b486852b17daa426","5c29df98b486852b17daa427","5c29df98b486852b17daa428","5c29df98b486852b17daa429","5c29df98b486852b17daa42a","5c29df98b486852b17daa42b","5c29df98b486852b17daa42c","5c29df98b486852b17daa42d","5c29df98b486852b17daa42e","5c29df98b486852b17daa42f","5c29df98b486852b17daa430","5c29df98b486852b17daa431","5c29df98b486852b17daa432","5c29df98b486852b17daa433","5c29df98b486852b17daa434","5c29df98b486852b17daa435","5c29df98b486852b17daa436","5c29df98b486852b17daa437","5c29df98b486852b17daa438","5c29df98b486852b17daa439","5c29df98b486852b17daa43a","5c29df98b486852b17daa43b","5c29df98b486852b17daa43c","5c29df98b486852b17daa43d","5c29df98b486852b17daa43e","5c29df98b486852b17daa43f","5c29df98b486852b17daa440","5c29df98b486852b17daa441","5c29df98b486852b17daa442","5c29df98b486852b17daa443","5c29df98b486852b17daa444","5c29df98b486852b17daa445","5c29df98b486852b17daa446","5c29df98b486852b17daa447","5c29df98b486852b17daa448","5c29df98b486852b17daa449","5c29df98b486852b17daa44a","5c29df98b486852b17daa44b","5c29df98b486852b17daa44c","5c29df98b486852b17daa44d","5c29df98b486852b17daa44e","5c29df98b486852b17daa44f","5c29df98b486852b17daa450","5c29df98b486852b17daa451","5c29df98b486852b17daa452","5c29df98b486852b17daa453","5c29df98b486852b17daa454","5c29df98b486852b17daa455","5c29df98b486852b17daa456","5c29df98b486852b17daa457","5c29df98b486852b17daa458","5c29df99b486852b17daa459","5c29df99b486852b17daa45a","5c29df99b486852b17daa45b","5c29df99b486852b17daa45c","5c29df99b486852b17daa45d","5c29df99b486852b17daa45e"],"year":"2004","zh_author":"萧伯纳","zh_bookname":"皮格马利翁和其他三部戏剧"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.02],"goodreads_ratings":[17287],"year":["2004"],"zh_bookname":["皮格马利翁和其他三部戏剧"],"author":["George Bernard Shaw"],"zh_author":["萧伯纳"],"bookname":["Pygmalion and three other plays"]}}

Some say he's a sage. He was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But this man, Siddhartha, was not a follower of any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence, and charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a life of pleasure and titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other \"child people,\" dragged around by his desires. Like Hermann Hesse's other creations of struggling young men, Siddhartha has a good dose of European angst and stubborn individualism. His final epiphany challenges both the Buddhist and the Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river. In this translation Sherab Chodzin Kohn captures the slow, spare lyricism of Siddhartha's search, putting her version on par with Hilda Rosner's standard edition. --Brian Bruya From Library Journal Siddhartha's life takes him on a journey toward enlightenment. Afire with youthful idealism, the Brahmin joins a group of ascetics, fasting and living without possessions. Meeting Gotama the Buddha, he comes to feel this is not the right path, though he also declines joining the Buddha's followers. He reenters the world, hoping to learn of his own nature, but instead slips gradually into hedonism and materialism. Surfeited and disgusted, he flees from his possessions to become a ferryman's apprentice, learning what lessons he can from the river itself. Herman Hesse's 1922 Bildungsroman parallels the life of Buddha and seems to argue that lessons of this sort cannot be taught but come from one's own struggle to find truth. Noted actor Derek Jacobi interprets this material wonderfully, and the package, despite abridging a Nobel prize winner's prose, can be highly recommended.AJohn Hiett, Iowa City P.L.

In fact he's frozen, incapacitated by his fear of death--and in the final year of the Reagan era, he's right to be afraid. His 55-year-old body, swollen with beer and munchies and racked with chest pains, wears its bulk \"like a set of blankets the decades have brought one by one.\" He suspects that his son Nelson, who's recently taken over the family car dealership, is embezzling money to support a cocaine habit. Indeed, from Rabbit's vantage point--which alternates between a winter condo in Florida and the ancestral digs in Pennsylvania, not to mention a detour to an intensive care unit--decay is overtaking the entire world. The budget deficit is destroying America, his accountant is dying of AIDS, and a terrorist bomb has just destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 above Lockerbie, Scotland. This last incident, with its rapid transit from life to death, hits Rabbit particularly hard: Imagine sitting there in your seat being lulled by the hum of the big Rolls-Royce engines and the stewardesses bring the clinking drinks caddy... and then with a roar and giant ripping noise and scattered screams this whole cozy world dropping away and nothing under you but black space and your chest squeezed by the terrible unbreathable cold, that cold you can scarcely believe is there but that you sometimes actually feel still packed into the suitcases, stored in the unpressurized hold, when you unpack your clothes, the dirty underwear and beach towels with the merciless chill of death from outer space still in them. Marching through the decades, John Updike's first three Rabbit novels-- Rabbit, Run (1960), Rabbit Redux (1971), and Rabbit Is Rich (1981)--dissect middle-class America in all its dysfunctional glory. Rabbit at Rest (1990), the final installment and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, continues this brilliant dissection. Yet it also develops Rabbit's character more fully as he grapples with an uncertain future and the consequences of his past. At one point, for example, he's taken his granddaughter Judy for a sailing expedition when his first heart attack strikes. Rabbit gamely navigates the tiny craft to shore--and then, lying on the beach, feels a paradoxical relief at having both saved his beloved Judy and meeting his own death. (He doesn't, not yet.) Meanwhile, this all-American dad feels responsible for his son's full-blown drug addiction but incapable of helping him. (Ironically, it's Rabbit's wife Janice, the \"poor dumb mutt,\" who marches Nelson into rehab.) His misplaced sense of responsibility--plus his crude sexual urges and racial slurs--can make Rabbit seems less than lovable. Still, there's something utterly heroic about his character. When the end comes, after all, it's the Angstrom family that refuses to accept the reality of Rabbit's mortality. Only Updike's irreplaceable mouthpiece rises to the occasion, delivering a stoical, one-word valediction: \"Enough.\" --Rob McDonald From Publishers Weekly Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, morbidly depressed, overweight and living with wife Janice in a Florida retirement community, recovers from a heart attack and is led astray by his libido one last time. \"Updike is razor-sharp and mordantly funny,\" said PW. \"If this novel is in some respects an elegy to Rabbit's bewildered existence, it is also a poignant, humorous, instructive guidebook to the aborted American dream.\" The book took a Pulitzer Prize.

If one word could sum up the young critic's approach to books and their authors it would be ''generosity'': ''Better to praise and share,'' he says in his Foreword, ''than to blame and ban.'' And so he follows his enthusiasms, which prove both deserving and infectious: Kierkegaard, Proust, Joyce, Dostoevsky, and Hamsun among the classics; Borges, Nabokov, Grass, Bellow, Cheever, and Jong among the contemporaries. Here too are meditations on Satan and cemeteries, travel essays on London and Anguilla, three very early ''golf dreams,'' and one big interview. Picked-Up Pieces is a glittering treasury for every reader who likes life, books, wit--and John Updike.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddddb48685135a22aef1.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.23,"goodreads_ratings":73,"level":5,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e719b486852b17ddede9","5c29e719b486852b17ddedea","5c29e719b486852b17ddedeb","5c29e719b486852b17ddedec","5c29e719b486852b17ddeded","5c29e719b486852b17ddedee","5c29e719b486852b17ddedef","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf0","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf1","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf2","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf3","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf4","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf5","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf6","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf7","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf8","5c29e719b486852b17ddedf9","5c29e719b486852b17ddedfa","5c29e719b486852b17ddedfb","5c29e719b486852b17ddedfc","5c29e719b486852b17ddedfd","5c29e719b486852b17ddedfe","5c29e719b486852b17ddedff","5c29e719b486852b17ddee00","5c29e719b486852b17ddee01","5c29e719b486852b17ddee02","5c29e719b486852b17ddee03","5c29e719b486852b17ddee04","5c29e719b486852b17ddee05","5c29e719b486852b17ddee06","5c29e719b486852b17ddee07","5c29e719b486852b17ddee08","5c29e719b486852b17ddee09","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0a","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0b","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0c","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0d","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0e","5c29e719b486852b17ddee0f","5c29e719b486852b17ddee10","5c29e719b486852b17ddee11","5c29e719b486852b17ddee12","5c29e719b486852b17ddee13","5c29e719b486852b17ddee14","5c29e719b486852b17ddee15","5c29e719b486852b17ddee16","5c29e719b486852b17ddee17","5c29e719b486852b17ddee18","5c29e719b486852b17ddee19","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1a","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1b","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1c","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1d","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1e","5c29e719b486852b17ddee1f","5c29e719b486852b17ddee20","5c29e719b486852b17ddee21","5c29e719b486852b17ddee22","5c29e719b486852b17ddee23","5c29e719b486852b17ddee24","5c29e719b486852b17ddee25","5c29e719b486852b17ddee26","5c29e719b486852b17ddee27","5c29e719b486852b17ddee28","5c29e719b486852b17ddee29","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2a","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2b","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2c","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2d","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2e","5c29e719b486852b17ddee2f","5c29e719b486852b17ddee30","5c29e719b486852b17ddee31","5c29e719b486852b17ddee32","5c29e719b486852b17ddee33","5c29e719b486852b17ddee34","5c29e719b486852b17ddee35","5c29e719b486852b17ddee36","5c29e719b486852b17ddee37","5c29e719b486852b17ddee38","5c29e719b486852b17ddee39","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3a","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3b","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3c","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3d","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3e","5c29e719b486852b17ddee3f","5c29e719b486852b17ddee40"],"year":"2013","zh_author":"约翰 厄普代克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"捡起的碎片"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.23],"goodreads_ratings":[73],"year":["2013"],"zh_bookname":["捡起的碎片"],"author":["John Updike"],"zh_author":["约翰 厄普代克"],"bookname":["Picked-Up Pieces"]}}

It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong. The Sympathizer is the story of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme politics, and a moving love story, The Sympathizer explores a life between two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de1db48685135a2472c6.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4,"goodreads_ratings":43306,"level":3,"publisher":"Perseus Book Group","segments":["5c29ea3fb486852b17df44f8","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44f9","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44fa","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44fb","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44fc","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44fd","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44fe","5c29ea3fb486852b17df44ff","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4500","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4501","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4502","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4503","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4504","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4505","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4506","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4507","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4508","5c29ea3fb486852b17df4509","5c29ea3fb486852b17df450a","5c29ea3fb486852b17df450b","5c29ea3fb486852b17df450c","5c29ea3fb486852b17df450d"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"越南阮","zh_bookname":"同情者"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4],"goodreads_ratings":[43306],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["同情者"],"author":["Viet Thanh Nguyen"],"zh_author":["越南阮"],"bookname":["The Sympathizer"]}}

Here his prose is again rich, graceful and luminous, and he exhibits a remarkable maturity of vision and understanding of the human condition. The marriage of Greek immigrant Constantine to Mary, the offspring of an Italian clan, is a mismatch of incompatible personalities, a union that is later maintained in a delicate balance between incomprehension and rage. The birth of their three children exacerbates the tension and leaves its indelible mark unto the third generation. When he becomes a partner in a shoddy construction company, Con lifts the Stassos family from near-poverty in Elizabeth, N.J., to a nouveau-riche enclave on Long Island, but his lifelong concern with money, and with exhibiting \"manliness,\" erupts into violent behavior that alienates his only son, Billy, even before the boy realizes that he is a homosexual. Con damages the other children, too; Susan escapes his sexual overtures through an early marriage, and wild, feral Zoe joins the drug culture in New York. Yet Cunningham condemns no one; he understands that Con \"exists in a chaos of yearning . . . [of] love and... hunger and... bottomless grief,\" and he portrays the other characters with equal sympathy. In delineating the story of this disconnected family, each member floating in his or her own sphere of bewilderment, anger, mistrust and fear but inextricably bound to others by flesh and blood, Cunningham illuminates the chasm between parents and children in contemporary America, beginning in the 1970s, when drug use and sexual freedom broke traditional constraints. Both fate and accident determine all of the characters' lives. Con betrays beautiful, distant Mary with his partner's fat, plain secretary?and ends up married to her. Mary becomes friends with Cassandra, a drag queen who is the godmother of Zoe's illegitimate half-black son. Billy renames himself Will, and finally finds a loving companion. All the characters are fallible and come late to self-knowledge. Cunningham's portraits are so honest and sensitive that we can see into their souls. His prose is both restrained and mesmerizing: individual scenes?such as one of teenagers in a car wreck?become incandescent images. In the end, what remains of Con and Mary's failed dreams of their lives and those of their children and grandchildren becomes a transcendent testament to the power of human endurance. 75,000 first printing; movie rights optioned by Tony Ganz/Wolf Productions; author tour. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal The story of Constantine Stassos freshly examines the American immigrant experience and conflict between generations. He, wife Mary, and three children Susan, Will, and Zoe seemingly embody solid middle-class values. However, Constantine's cruelty, voracious appetites, and questionable business practices poison his marriage and brutalize his children. Through painful quests for independence, personal balance, and community, the Stassos children learn acceptance of themselves and their siblings. Fairly brief episodes, often occuring years apart, recount key moments in the establishment, disintegration, and reconfiguration of the family.

The setting is an Alpine ski resort, built on the profits generated by tourism and a polluting paper plant. The director of the plant is a swaggering vulgarian who divides his time between oppressing his workers and having sex with his wife. Like virtually all the book's characters, he is driven by his insatiable lust. His wife, Gerti, is gradually breaking down under this constant sexual attention, drinking heavily, until one day she wanders out of the house in a dressing gown and slippers. She is \"rescued\" by Michael, an ambitious young man with designs on a political career, who is no less of a sexual predator than her husband. Jelinek tells this story in a compulsively punning, often witty prose (skillfully translated by Hulse), but the book is disfigured by repetitiveness and the author's undisguised contempt for her characters. Marriage is depicted as little more than legalized prostitution, women are trapped and pummeled but unworthy of sympathy, children are greedy little narcissists, everyone is corrupt, venal and stupid. The town is little more than a parody of Marx's description of capitalism as the war of each against all. Ultimately, for all the considerable skill with which Lust is crafted, it is shrill and deadening. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd96b48685135a212acc.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.29,"goodreads_ratings":1074,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e48cb486852b17dcc095","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc096","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc097","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc098","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc099","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09a","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09b","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09c","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09d","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09e","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc09f","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc0a0","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc0a1","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc0a2","5c29e48cb486852b17dcc0a3"],"year":"1993","zh_author":"埃尔弗里德 耶利内克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"强烈欲望"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.29],"goodreads_ratings":[1074],"year":["1993"],"zh_bookname":["强烈欲望"],"author":["Elfriede Jelinek"],"zh_author":["埃尔弗里德 耶利内克"],"bookname":["Lust"]}}

On the eve of an execution, Temple is forced to confront her past as she explores how earlier violent events influenced the murder of her infant child by its nurse, Nancy. Beginning with the judgement of Nancys death sentence, Faulkners taut narrative focuses on how ones past can impact the future of an entire family. Published in 1950, 19 years after Sanctuary , Requiem for a Nun is unique for Faulkners use of both prose and play narrative. It was adapted for theater in 1956 by Albert Camus, who also wrote the preface to the French translation of the novel.

From the Inside Flap This sequel to Faulkner's SANCTUARY written 20 years later, takes up the story of Temple Drake eight years after the events related in SANCTUARY. From the Trade Paperback edition. About the Author William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously. Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, The Marble Faun , at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, Soldiers Pay , was published in 1926, followed a year later by Mosquitoes , a literary satire. His next book, Flags in the Dust , was heavily cut and rearranged at the publishers insistence and appeared finally as Sartoris in 1929. In the meantime he had completed The Sound and the Fury , and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished Sanctuary and was ready to begin writing As I Lay Dying . That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier. Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels Light in August (1932), Pylon (1935), Absalom, Absalom! (1936), The Unvanquished (1938), The Wild Palms (1939), The Hamlet (1940), and Go Down, Moses (1942)and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on To Have and Have Not , The Big Sleep , and Land of the Pharaohs , among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology The Portable Faulkner brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature. Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in The Sound and the Fury . No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkners imagination, Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowleys anthology. The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlersall are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations. In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books Intruder in the Dust (1948), Requiem for a Nun (1951), A Fable (1954), The Town (1957), The Mansion (1959), and The Reivers (1962)he continued to explore what he had called the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself, but did so in the context of Yoknapatawphas increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddeeb48685135a2337c0.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.56,"goodreads_ratings":816,"level":3,"publisher":"HarperCollins","segments":["5c29e80bb486852b17de5956","5c29e80bb486852b17de5957","5c29e80bb486852b17de5958","5c29e80bb486852b17de5959","5c29e80bb486852b17de595a","5c29e80bb486852b17de595b"],"year":"1950","zh_author":"威廉福克纳","zh_bookname":"修女安魂曲"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.56],"goodreads_ratings":[816],"year":["1950"],"zh_bookname":["修女安魂曲"],"author":["William Faulkner"],"zh_author":["威廉福克纳"],"bookname":["Requiem for a Nun"]}}

As well as the many international awards it received, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Governor General's Award, the book also met with universal critical acclaim and topped bestseller lists around the world. \"Carol Shields,\" raved Maclean's , \"has crafted a small miracle of a novel.\" \" The Stone Diaries ,\" said the New York Times Book Review , \"reminds us again why literature matters.\" The San Diego Tribune called The Stone Diaries \"a universal study of what makes women tick.\" Now, in Larry's Party , Carol Shields does the same for men. Larry Weller, born in 1950, is an ordinary guy made extraordinary by his creator's perception, irony and tenderness. Larry's Party gives us, as it were, a CAT scan of his life, in episodes between 1977 and 1997 that flash backward and forward seamlessly. As Larry journeys toward the new millennium, adapting to society's changing expectations of men, Shields' elegant prose transforms the trivial into the momentous. We follow this young floral designer through two marriages and divorces, his interactions with parents, friends and a son. And throughout, we witness his deepening passion for garden mazes -- so like life, with their teasing treachery and promise of reward. Among all the paradoxes and accidents of his existence, Larry moves through the spontaneity of the seventies, the blind enchantment of the eighties and the lean, mean nineties, completing at last his quiet, stubborn search for self.

Who is Mary Swann? In this novel of a writer s revenge, an uneducated farmer s wife delivers a paper bag filled with scraps of her poems to the publisher of a small press. Hours later, she s dead, murdered by her husband. Fifteen years on, her book of one hundred twenty-five poems Mary Swann s sole claim to fame is discovered by an American academic. And a literary odyssey begins. Four narrators Sarah Maloney, a feminist writer; Frederic Cruzzi, an editor; Morton Jimroy, a biographer; and Rose Hindmarch, Mary s only friend all have a stake in the deceased poet s work. Their chorus of voicesopens a fascinating window on what constitutes genius. As the four descend into a quagmire of ego, jealousy, and backstabbing, Mary Swann comes back to life in the minds and hearts of those who love and hate her most. Full of mischief, Swann is a novel about life, death, and the ideas that live on after us.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de06b48685135a23db52.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.71,"goodreads_ratings":1801,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e947b486852b17ded2cc","5c29e947b486852b17ded2cd","5c29e947b486852b17ded2ce","5c29e947b486852b17ded2cf","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d0","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d1","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d2","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d3","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d4","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d5","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d6","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d7","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d8","5c29e947b486852b17ded2d9","5c29e947b486852b17ded2da","5c29e947b486852b17ded2db","5c29e947b486852b17ded2dc","5c29e947b486852b17ded2dd","5c29e947b486852b17ded2de","5c29e947b486852b17ded2df"],"year":"","zh_author":"卡罗尔 希尔兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"斯旺[玛丽斯旺]"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.71],"goodreads_ratings":[1801],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["斯旺[玛丽斯旺]"],"author":["Carol Shields"],"zh_author":["卡罗尔 希尔兹"],"bookname":["Swann [Mary Swann]"]}}

A unique institution, the beth din was a combined court of law, synagogue, scholarly institution, and psychologist's office where people sought out the advice and counsel of a neighborhood rabbi.

He was famous for encouraging interruptions of the solitary task of writing. These twenty-four welcomed interruptions are representative of the many he allowed over a twenty-five-year period. Included here are his conversations with such interviewers as Irving Howe, Laurie Colwin, Richard Burgin, and Herbert R. Lottman. In these talks Singer discusses the nature of his writing, its ethnic roots, his demonology, the importance of free will, and the place of storytelling in human life. The interviews with Singer reveal both his impish sense of humor and a determination that sustained him through many years of limited acclaim and comparative neglect by critics. Yiddishists often faulted him for refusing to use his talent as a force for change in the world, Jewish readers often deplored his use of pre-Enlightenment folk material, and academics could not take too seriously a writer who insisted on telling stories that emphasized plot and character. Yet he was not deterred from his astonishing and beloved work, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd39b48685135a1eecb4.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.26,"goodreads_ratings":38,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e06db486852b17daf8a5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8a6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8a7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8a8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8a9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8aa","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ab","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ac","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ad","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ae","5c29e06db486852b17daf8af","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b0","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b1","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b2","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b3","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b4","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8b9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ba","5c29e06db486852b17daf8bb","5c29e06db486852b17daf8bc","5c29e06db486852b17daf8bd","5c29e06db486852b17daf8be","5c29e06db486852b17daf8bf","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c0","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c1","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c2","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c3","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c4","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8c9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ca","5c29e06db486852b17daf8cb","5c29e06db486852b17daf8cc","5c29e06db486852b17daf8cd","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ce","5c29e06db486852b17daf8cf","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d0","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d1","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d2","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d3","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d4","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8d9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8da","5c29e06db486852b17daf8db","5c29e06db486852b17daf8dc","5c29e06db486852b17daf8dd","5c29e06db486852b17daf8de","5c29e06db486852b17daf8df","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e0","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e1","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e2","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e3","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e4","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8e9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ea","5c29e06db486852b17daf8eb","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ec","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ed","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ee","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ef","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f0","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f1","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f2","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f3","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f4","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f5","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f6","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f7","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f8","5c29e06db486852b17daf8f9","5c29e06db486852b17daf8fa","5c29e06db486852b17daf8fb","5c29e06db486852b17daf8fc","5c29e06db486852b17daf8fd","5c29e06db486852b17daf8fe","5c29e06db486852b17daf8ff","5c29e06db486852b17daf900","5c29e06db486852b17daf901","5c29e06db486852b17daf902","5c29e06db486852b17daf903","5c29e06db486852b17daf904","5c29e06db486852b17daf905"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"艾萨克巴什维斯歌手","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"与艾萨克 巴什维斯 辛格的对话"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.26],"goodreads_ratings":[38],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["与艾萨克 巴什维斯 辛格的对话"],"author":["Isaac Bashevis Singer"],"zh_author":["艾萨克巴什维斯歌手"],"bookname":["Conversations with Isaac Bashevis Singer"]}}

When I was in my twenties I asked I.B. Singer to inscribe this book, after awkwardly showing him one of my pieces. The current version of Short Friday has a picture of Barbara Streisand as Yentl on the cover--which somehow strikes me as unfortunate message about a writer who went way beyond the mainstram. To like this collection, you have to like Singer--his terse style (\"my favorite part of speech is the noun\" he said), and the kinds of stories he wrote--often folk tales with dark demons and illuminating moments--or stories about people who immigrated to America. (His story \"The Letter Writer,\" in another collection is a magnificant fusion of these two.) Singer is a master along with Isaac Babel. His stories manage to be rich with characters yet have the simplicity of fables. Without any sentiment, they are infused with affection. Also, interestingly, they are are a form of magic realism long before it became popular because their excursions into the world of ghosts, imps and demons are drawn from a community of shared beliefs. In \"A Wedding in Brownswville,\" ghosts appear from the walls and dance with the guests. In \"The Last Demon,\" we hear the voice of a demon who draws his sustenance from a Yiddish storybook. There is great darkness in these stories, as well as light--and they were written at a time when the supernatural was hardly popular.

When the Sultan commissions a great book to celebrate his royal self and his extensive dominion, he directs Enishte Effendi to assemble a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed, and no one in the elite circle can know the full scope or nature of the project. Panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears, and the Sultan demands answers within three days. The only clue to the mystery-or crime?-lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Has an avenging angel discovered the blasphemous work? Or is a jealous contender for the hand of Enishtes ravishing daughter, the incomparable Shekure, somehow to blame? Orhan Pamuks My Name Is Red is at once a fantasy and a philosophical puzzle, a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex, and power. \"Pamuk is a novelist and a great oneMy Name is Red is by far the grandest and most astonishing contest in his internal East-West warIt is chock-full of sublimity and sinThe story is told by each of a dozen characters, and now and then by a dog, a tree, a gold coin, several querulous corpses and the color crimson ('My Name is Red')[Readers will] be lofted by the paradoxical lightness and gaiety of the writing, by the wonderfully winding talk perpetually about to turn a corner, and by the stubborn humanity in the characters' maneuvers to survive. It is a humanity whose lies and silences emerge as endearing and oddly bracing individual truths.\"- Richard Eder, New York Times Book Review \"A murder mystery set in sixteenth-century Istanbul [that] uses the art of miniature illumination, much as Mann's 'Doctor Faustus' did music, to explore a nation's soul Erdag Goknar deserves praise for the cool, smooth English in which he has rendered Pamuk's finespun sentences, passionate art appreciations, sly pedantic debates, [and] eerie urban scenes.\"- John Updike, The New Yorker \"The interweaving of human and philosophical intrigue is very much as I remember it in The Name of the Rose, as is the slow, dense beginning and the relentless gathering of pace But, in my view, his book is by far the better of the two. I would go so far as to say that Pamuk achieves the very thing his book implies is impossible More than any other book I can think of, it captures not just Istanbul's past and present contradictions, but also its terrible, timeless beauty. It's almost perfect, in other words. All it needs is the Nobel Prize.\"-Maureen Freely, New Statesman (UK) \"A perfect example of Pamuk's method as a novelist, which is to combine literary trickery with page-turning readability As a meditation on art, in particular, My Name is Red is exquisitely subtle, demanding and repaying the closest attention.. We in the West can only feel grateful that such a novelist as Pamuk exists, to act as a bridge between our culture and that of a heritage quite as rich as our own.\"-Tom Holland, Daily Telegraph (UK) \"Readers will find themselves lured into a richly described and remarkable world Reading the novel is like being in a magically exotic dreamSplendidly enjoyable and rewarding A book in which you can thoroughly immerse yourself.\" -Allan Massie, The Scotsman (UK) \"A wonderful novel, dreamy, passionate and august, exotic in the most original and exciting way. Orhan Pamuk is indisputably a major novelist.\"-Philip Hensher, The Spectator (UK) \"[In this] magnificent new novel Pamuk takes the reader into the strange and beautiful world of Islamic art,in which Western notions no longer make sense In this world of forgeries, where some might be in danger of losing their faith in literature, Pamuk is the real thing, and this book might well be one of the few recent works of fiction that will be remembered at the end of this century.\"-Avkar Altinel, The Observer (UK)","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd06b48685135a1d7e8a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.83,"goodreads_ratings":36783,"level":4,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5ec","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5ed","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5ee","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5ef","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f0","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f1","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f2","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f3","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f4","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f5","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f6","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f7","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f8","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5f9","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5fa","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5fb","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5fc","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5fd","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5fe","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5ff","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d600","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d601","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d602","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d603","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d604","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d605","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d606","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d607","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d608","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d609","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60a","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60b","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60c","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60d","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60e","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d60f","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d610","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d611","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d612","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d613","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d614","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d615","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d616","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d617","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d618","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d619","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d61a","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d61b"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"奥尔汉帕穆克","zh_bookname":"我的名字叫瑞德"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.83],"goodreads_ratings":[36783],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["我的名字叫瑞德"],"author":["Orhan Pamuk"],"zh_author":["奥尔汉帕穆克"],"bookname":["My Name is Red"]}}

In an old mansion in Cennethisar, a former fishing village near Istanbul, a widow, Fatma, awaits the annual summer visit of her grandchildren. She has lived in the village for decades, ever since her husband, an idealistic young doctor, ran afoul of the sultan s grand vizier and arrived to serve the poor fishermen. Now mostly bedridden, she is attended by her constant servant Recep, a dwarf -- and the doctor s illegitimate son. Despite mutual dependency, there is no love lost between mistress and servant, who have very different recollections -- and grievances -- from the early years, before Cennethisar grew into a high-class resort surrounding the family house, now in shambles. Though eagerly anticipated, Fatma s grandchildren bring little consolation. The eldest, Faruk, a dissipated historian, wallows in alcohol as he laments his inability to tell the story of the past from the kaleidoscopic pieces he finds in the local archive; his sensitive leftist sister, Nilg n, has yet to discover the real-life consequences of highminded politics; and Metin, a high school nerd, tries to keep up with the lifestyle of his spoiled society schoolmates while he fantasizes about going to America -- an unaffordable dream unless he can persuade his grandmother to tear down her house. But it is Recep s nephew Hasan, a high school dropout, lately fallen in with right-wing nationalists, who will draw the visiting family into the growing political cataclysm issuing from Turkey s tumultuous century-long struggle for modernity. By turns deeply moving, hilarious, and terrifying, Silent House pulses with the special energy of a great writer s early work even as it offers beguiling evidence of the mature genius for which Orhan Pamuk would later be celebrated the world over.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd5b48685135a227154.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.69,"goodreads_ratings":5083,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd7d","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd7e","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd7f","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd80","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd81","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd82","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd83","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd84","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd85","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd86","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd87","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd88","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd89","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8a","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8b","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8c","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8d","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8e","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd8f","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd90","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd91","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd92","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd93","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd94","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd95","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd96","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd97","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd98","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd99","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9a","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9b","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9c","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9d","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9e","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbd9f","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda0","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda1","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda2","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda3","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda4","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda5","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda6","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda7","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda8","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbda9","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdaa","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdab","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdac","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdad","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdae","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdaf","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb0","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb1","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb2","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb3","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb4","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb5","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb6","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb7","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb8","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdb9","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdba","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdbb","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdbc","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdbd","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdbe","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdbf","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc0","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc1","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc2","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc3","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc4","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc5","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc6","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc7","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc8","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdc9","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdca","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdcb","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdcc","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdcd","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdce","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdcf","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdd0","5c29e6bcb486852b17ddbdd1"],"year":"1995","zh_author":"奥尔汉帕穆克","zh_bookname":"寂静之家"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.69],"goodreads_ratings":[5083],"year":["1995"],"zh_bookname":["寂静之家"],"author":["Orhan Pamuk"],"zh_author":["奥尔汉帕穆克"],"bookname":["Silent House"]}}

This is a work of strange beauty, with a tender touch of nostalgia and a heartbreaking sensitivity to those things lost forever.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddfeb48685135a239e9a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.86,"goodreads_ratings":6120,"level":2,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e8deb486852b17dea809","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80a","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80b","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80c","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80d","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80e","5c29e8deb486852b17dea80f","5c29e8deb486852b17dea810","5c29e8deb486852b17dea811","5c29e8deb486852b17dea812","5c29e8deb486852b17dea813","5c29e8deb486852b17dea814","5c29e8deb486852b17dea815","5c29e8deb486852b17dea816","5c29e8deb486852b17dea817","5c29e8deb486852b17dea818","5c29e8deb486852b17dea819","5c29e8deb486852b17dea81a","5c29e8deb486852b17dea81b","5c29e8deb486852b17dea81c","5c29e8deb486852b17dea81d","5c29e8deb486852b17dea81e"],"year":"2013","zh_author":"川端康成","zh_bookname":"美与悲"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.86],"goodreads_ratings":[6120],"year":["2013"],"zh_bookname":["美与悲"],"author":["Yasunari Kawabata"],"zh_author":["川端康成"],"bookname":["Beauty and Sadness"]}}

As the Vera journeys across the Atlantic, the incidents and intrigues of several dozen passengers and crew members come into razor-sharp focus. The result is a richly drawn portrait of the human condition in all its complexity and a mesmerizing snapshot of a world drifting toward disaster.

Magnolia Hawks spends her childhood aboard the ''Cotton Blossom,'' growing up amid simmering racial tension and struggling to survive life on the Mississippi. When she falls in love with the dashing Gaylord Ravenal and moves with him to Chicago, the joy of giving birth to their beautiful daughter, Kim, is offset by Gaylord's gambling addiction and distrustful ways. Only when Kim sets off on her own to pursue success on the New York stage does Magnolia return to the ''Cotton Blossom,'' reflecting on her own life and all who once called the show boat their home. Originally published in 1926, adapted for the stage as a musical a year later and filmed three times over three decades, ''Show Boat'' brilliantly explores a nation going pivotal change through the lens of its popular culture.

After spending the last 15 years traveling between small Midwest towns or living in New York City, Emma sets off on a boat trip down the coast of the continent to sell her T. A. Buck Featherloom petticoats and skirts in Argentina, where she takes the country by storm. Based on the last two books I knew romance was headed Emma s way, but she d been so determinedly independent I wasn t sure I would like it--I did. Along with being good stories these books charmed and fascinated me by presenting a lively picture of how people lived, thought, worked, played, dressed, traveled, raised their children, and fell in love 100 years ago during the early decades of the 1900 s. In one chapter Emma was forced to deal with wealthy lady organizers bent promoting their pet cause, which wasn t Votes for women as I had guessed, but instead a self-righteous insistence based on their rigid uneven morality that working class girls must be convinced to dress with drab unassuming modesty as befits their station. I would have been disappointed if Emma turned out to be an anti-suffragette, but Emma was right to poke a little good natured fun at these women. Ferber wrote all three Emma McChesney novels long enough ago that they re in the public domain so ebook versions can be downloaded from sites like Project Gutenberg. I listened to superbly narrated audio versions available on the Libravox website that made me almost enjoy my commute--I had witty Emma and her adventures to keep me occupied.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de08b48685135a23f059.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.97,"goodreads_ratings":68,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e971b486852b17dee411","5c29e971b486852b17dee412","5c29e971b486852b17dee413","5c29e971b486852b17dee414","5c29e971b486852b17dee415","5c29e971b486852b17dee416","5c29e971b486852b17dee417","5c29e971b486852b17dee418","5c29e971b486852b17dee419","5c29e971b486852b17dee41a","5c29e971b486852b17dee41b","5c29e971b486852b17dee41c","5c29e971b486852b17dee41d","5c29e971b486852b17dee41e"],"year":"","zh_author":"埃德纳 菲伯","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"艾玛 麦卡斯尼（Emma McChesney＆Co）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.97],"goodreads_ratings":[68],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["艾玛 麦卡斯尼（Emma McChesney＆Co）"],"author":["Edna Ferber"],"zh_author":["埃德纳 菲伯"],"bookname":["Emma McChesney & Co"]}}

The other two are \"Bosnian Chronicle\" and \"The Bridge on the Drina\". The novel is set in the cities of Sarajevo and Belgrade during the first three decades of this century. The places and time are not incidentally chosen. Ivo Andri is from Bosnia and knows the people and their problems in this unique area. The theme and composition suggest a work of modern classicism. It is the tragic life of a woman disappointed in people and in the world she lives in. She is completely enslaved by money, in which she hopes to find security and revenge in a hateful and insecure world. At the same time she is literally and feverishly following her bankrupt father s last plea, as she becomes not only thrifty but a real miser in a classical Gogolian style. This novel is dominated by a single character, a spinster named Miss Raika Radakovi who is dominated by a single passion, stinginess. The development of this passion is traced through the first third of this century, from the time Miss Raika s dying father, a ruined merchant, solemnly enjoins his school-girl-daughter to guard with her life the little property he can leave her, until some thirty-five years later when she herself dies, a scrawny old woman, unloved and unlovable, but faithful to her trust. As a moneylender she parlays small insurance legacy after her father into a small fortune. But whatever her wealth at any time, she will spend none of it on herself. For this single-minded greed for money she puts everything else out of her life love, friendship, concern for other people. Raika also speculates in currencies during the tumultuous years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the uncertain emergence of the new Yugoslav state. A good deal of the power of Andri s tale comes through the depiction of this seething historical background, in whose torrent the wretched Raika s life is washed along like a piece of flotsam. The novel is carefully thought out and fully imagined, with solid passages of description in the nineteenth-century manner and scrupulous attentions to the job of relating the individual life to the broader pattern of social and economical change With brilliant economy Andri sketches the stages through which Miss Raika hoards and increases her inheritance: Sarajevo in the era of provincial usury, the economic upheavals and disintegration of the First World War, staid Belgrade headily embarking on the jazz age when the war is over, the pinched depression years during which Miss Raika dies. The requisite drama the testing of the ruling passion is present in the form of a young man whose physical resemblance to a beloved uncle long dead touches Miss Raika s heart enough to make her swerve, though only momentarily, from her objective of never parting with her money. The chronicle is Andri s favorite form, and this novel is no exception, a highly poetic form depicting the past and the present in a meticulous artistic and philosophical manner. Detailed historical analysis serves as a chain and always gives a basis for philosophical interpretation.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd59b48685135a1fd306.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.17,"goodreads_ratings":1123,"level":3,"publisher":"Dereta","segments":["5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae0","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae1","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae2","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae3","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae4","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae5","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae6","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae7","5c29e20ab486852b17dbaae8"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊沃安德烈","zh_bookname":"来自萨拉热窝的女人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.17],"goodreads_ratings":[1123],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["来自萨拉热窝的女人"],"author":["Ivo Andri"],"zh_author":["伊沃安德烈"],"bookname":["Woman from Sarajevo"]}}

San Francisco Chronicle In this, his last novel, Jos Saramago daringly reimagines the characters and narratives of the Old Testament, recalling his provocative The Gospel According to Jesus Christ . His tale runs from the Garden of Eden, when God realizes he has forgotten to give Adam and Eve the gift of speech, to the moment when Noah s Ark lands on the dry peak of Ararat. Cain, the despised, the murderer, is Saramago s protagonist. Condemned to wander forever after he kills his brother Abel, Cain makes his way through the world in the company of a personable donkey. He is a witness to and participant in the stories of Isaac and Abraham, the destruction of the Tower of Babel, Moses and the golden calf, the trials of Job. The rapacious Queen Lilith takes him as her lover. An old man with two sheep on a rope crosses his path. And again and again, Cain encounters a God whose actions seem callous, cruel, and unjust. He confronts Him, he argues with Him. And one thing we know for certain, Saramago writes, is that they continued to argue and are arguing still. A startling book sensual, funny and in all ways a fitting end to Saramago s extraordinary career. A winkingly blasphemous retelling of the Old Testament . . . Saramago, playfully stretching his chatty late style, pokes holes in the stated logic of the Biblical God throughout the novel.

On the journey home, Theodora finds there is little to choose between the reality of illusion and the illusion of reality. She looks for peace, even if it is beyond the borders of insanity.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddfdb48685135a23960a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Australia","segments":["5c29e8c8b486852b17dea04c","5c29e8c8b486852b17dea04d","5c29e8c8b486852b17dea04e"],"year":"","zh_author":"帕特里克白","zh_bookname":"姑姑的故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["姑姑的故事"],"author":["Patrick White"],"zh_author":["帕特里克白"],"bookname":["The Aunt's Story"]}}

Her new novel, set in the 1850s, speaks to us in a splendidly quirky voice--the strong, wry, no-nonsense voice of Lidie Harkness of Quincy, Illinois, a young woman of courage, good sense, and good heart. It carries us into an America so violently torn apart by the question of slavery that it makes our current political battlegrounds seem a peaceable kingdom. Lidie is hard to scare. She is almost shockingly alive--a tall, plain girl who rides and shoots and speaks her mind, and whose straightforward ways paradoxically amount to a kind of glamour. We see her at twenty, making a good marriage--to Thomas Newton, a steady, sweet-tempered Yankee who passes through her hometown on a dangerous mission. He belongs to a group of rashly brave New England abolitionists who dedicate themselves to settling the Kansas Territory with like-minded folk to ensure its entering the Union as a Free State. Lidie packs up and goes with him. And the novel races alongside them into the Territory, into the maelstrom of \"Bloody Kansas,\" where slaveholding Missourians constantly and viciously clash with Free Staters, where wandering youths kill you as soon as look at you--where Lidie becomes even more fervently abolitionist than her husband as the young couple again and again barely escape entrapment in webs of atrocity on both sides of the great question. And when, suddenly, cold-blooded murder invades her own intimate circle, Lidie doesn't falter. She cuts off her hair, disguises herself as a boy, and rides into Missouri in search of the killers--a woman in a fiercely male world, an abolitionist spy in slave territory. On the run, her life threatened, her wits sharpened, she takes on yet another identity--and, in the very midst of her masquerade, discovers herself. Lidie grows increasingly important to us as we follow her travels and adventures on the feverish eve of the War Between the States. With its crackling portrayal of a totally individual and wonderfully articulate woman, its storytelling drive, and its powerful recapturing of an almost forgotten part of the American story, this is Jane Smiley at her enthralling and enriching best.

Dejected and tired of life, he finds little solace in his family affairs and turns his attentions to his secretary, Milly Burden, in a last-ditch attempt to inject some spice in to his life. With the arrival of Littlepage s domineering daughter who returns from a life of war work and philanthropy comes a new series of interpersonal problems for all concerned. They Stooped to Folly is an engrossing tale of love, loss, deceit and dedication guaranteed to pull the reader into the midst of the chaos caused by the problems of family, love, and duty. Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow was an American novelist whose work illustrated the societal changes of the contemporary south. Amongst her most famous works are In This our Life (1941), which won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an eponymous named film by Warner Brothers, and The Sheltered Life (1932). This book, originally published in 1929, is now published with a new introductory biography of the author.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd0b48685135a226189.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.63,"goodreads_ratings":8,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e69bb486852b17ddb051","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb052","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb053","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb054","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb055","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb056","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb057","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb058","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb059","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05a","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05b","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05c","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05d","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05e","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb05f","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb060","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb061","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb062","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb063","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb064","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb065","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb066","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb067","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb068","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb069","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06a","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06b","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06c","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06d","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06e","5c29e69bb486852b17ddb06f"],"year":"","zh_author":"格拉斯哥","zh_bookname":"他们堕落到愚蠢的境地。"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.63],"goodreads_ratings":[8],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["他们堕落到愚蠢的境地。"],"author":["Ellen Glasgow"],"zh_author":["格拉斯哥"],"bookname":["They Stooped to Folly"]}}

Simili qualit , infatti, farebbero piuttosto supporre l arte collaudata dall esperienza di uno scrittore maturo. Il tema che accomuna le storie la presenza dell arcano, ma l aspetto che le differenzia da altre illustri prove del genere il fatto che l elemento misterioso, soprannaturale o terrificante resti per lo pi suggerito e come consegnato alla decodificazione del lettore tramite interrogativi inespressi. Questo a mio avviso le rende particolarmente inquietanti, in quanto restano impresse a lungo nella mente in attesa di una interpretazione univoca e convincente. Ciascuna vicenda, poi, si avvale di ambientazioni, personaggi e situazioni talmente originali e sagacemente definiti da costituire una sorta di universo a s stante, un piccolo immenso contesto dal quale lasciarsi turbare e incantare. Difficile esprimere preferenze in quanto, per usare la definizione di Borges, si tratta in genere di laconici capolavori . - Il risci fantasma - La strana cavalcata di Morrowbie Jukes - L'uomo che volle essere re - La mia vera storia di fantasmi","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd4db48685135a1f770c.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.53,"goodreads_ratings":591,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e164b486852b17db64b1","5c29e164b486852b17db64b2","5c29e164b486852b17db64b3","5c29e164b486852b17db64b4","5c29e164b486852b17db64b5","5c29e164b486852b17db64b6","5c29e164b486852b17db64b7","5c29e164b486852b17db64b8","5c29e164b486852b17db64b9"],"year":"","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"幻影《人力车》和其他鬼故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.53],"goodreads_ratings":[591],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["幻影《人力车》和其他鬼故事"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["The Phantom 'Rickshaw and Other Ghost Stories"]}}

Alone on his New England mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, no terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work and the enduring of old age. Walking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections that explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young couple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will flee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to city life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap his solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jamie, whose allure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: intimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body. The second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman's youth, Amy Bellette, companion and muse to...","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd0eb48685135a1dc1b0.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.49,"goodreads_ratings":4324,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29de27b486852b17da0631","5c29de27b486852b17da0632","5c29de27b486852b17da0633","5c29de27b486852b17da0634"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"菲利普罗斯","zh_bookname":"出鬼"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.49],"goodreads_ratings":[4324],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["出鬼"],"author":["Philip Roth"],"zh_author":["菲利普罗斯"],"bookname":["Exit Ghost"]}}

His gift for writing about women -- their love for reckless, hopeless men; their ability to see the good in losers; and their peculiar combination of emotional strength and sudden weakness -- makes The Desert Rose the bittersweet, funny, and touching book that it is. Harmony is a Las Vegas showgirl. At night she's a lead dancer in a gambling casino; during the day she raises peacocks. She's one of a dying breed of dancers, faced with fewer and fewer jobs and an even bleaker future. Yet she maintains a calm cheerfulness in that arid neon landscape of supermarkets, drive-in wedding chapels, and all-night casinos. While Harmony's star is fading, her beautiful, cynical daughter Pepper's is on the rise. But Harmony remains wistful and optimistic through it all.

Cadillac Jack is a rodeo-cowboy-turned-antique-scout whose nomadic, womanizing life -- centered on his classic pearl-colored Cadillac -- rambles between the Texas flatlands of flea markets and small-time auctions and Washington, D.C.'s political-social life of parties, hustlers, vixens, and spies. Along the way he meets a cast of indelibly etched characters: among them, the strikingly beautiful, social-climbing Cindy Sanders; Boog Miller, the tackily-dressing millionaire good ole boy who patronizes Jack's business and who has more political muscle than a litter of lobbyists; Khaki Descartes, the pushy, brain-picking, Washington woman reporter; Freddy Fu, an undercover CIA agent working out of a greasy barbecue joint called The Cover-Up; and Jean Arber, the mother of two and a fledgling antique-store owner who can't quite figure out if she'll marry Jack or not. Wild, touching, and hilariously funny, Cadillac Jack is Larry McMurtry's raucous social satire of sex, politics, and love in the fast lane, peopled with Americans only he could render.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd45b48685135a1f4469.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.58,"goodreads_ratings":1300,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e10ab486852b17db3dfe","5c29e10ab486852b17db3dff","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e00","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e01","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e02","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e03","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e04","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e05","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e06","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e07","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e08","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e09","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0a","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0b","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0c","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0d","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0e","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e0f","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e10","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e11","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e12","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e13","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e14","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e15","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e16","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e17","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e18","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e19","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1a","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1b","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1c","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1d","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1e","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e1f","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e20","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e21","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e22","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e23","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e24","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e25","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e26","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e27","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e28","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e29","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2a","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2b","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2c","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2d","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2e","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e2f","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e30","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e31","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e32","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e33","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e34","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e35","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e36","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e37","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e38","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e39","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3a","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3b","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3c","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3d","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3e","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e3f","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e40","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e41","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e42","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e43","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e44","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e45","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e46","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e47","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e48","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e49","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e4a","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e4b","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e4c","5c29e10ab486852b17db3e4d"],"year":"","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"凯迪拉克千斤顶"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.58],"goodreads_ratings":[1300],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["凯迪拉克千斤顶"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["Cadillac Jack"]}}

Call in their middle years, just beginning to deal with the perplexing tensions of adult life - Gus and his great love, Clara Forsythe; Call and Maggie Tilton, the young whore who loves him - when they enlist with a Ranger troop in pursuit of Buffalo Hump, the great Comanche war chief; Kicking Wolf, the celebrated Comanche horse thief; and a deadly Mexican bandit king with a penchant for torture. Assisting the Rangers in their wild chase is the renowned Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. Comanche Moon joins the twenty-year time line between Dead Man's Walk and Lonesome Dove , as we follow beloved heroes Gus and Call and their comrades-in-arms - Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker - in their bitter struggle to protect an advancing Western frontier against the defiant Comanches, courageously determined to defend their territory and their way of life. At once realistic and yet vividly imagined, Comanche Moon is a giant of a book - written by one of America's most honored and distinguished novelists - and the keystone to a mighty achievement of storytelling, unparalleled for its sweep, its meticulous re-creation of the past, its sheer energy, and its celebration of life: an epic adventure full of heroism, tragedy, cruelty, courage, honor and betrayal, and the culmination of Larry McMurtry's peerless vision of the American West.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd94b48685135a211bbe.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4,"goodreads_ratings":9628,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5ef","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f0","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f1","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f2","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f3","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f4","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f5","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f6","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f7","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f8","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5f9","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5fa","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5fb","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5fc","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5fd","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5fe","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb5ff","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb600","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb601","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb602","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb603","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb604","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb605","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb606","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb607","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb608","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb609","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60a","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60b","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60c","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60d","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60e","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb60f","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb610","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb611","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb612","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb613","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb614","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb615","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb616","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb617","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb618","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb619","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61a","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61b","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61c","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61d","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61e","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb61f","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb620","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb621","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb622","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb623","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb624","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb625","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb626","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb627","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb628","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb629","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb62a","5c29e46eb486852b17dcb62b"],"year":"1998","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"月满荒原"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4],"goodreads_ratings":[9628],"year":["1998"],"zh_bookname":["月满荒原"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["Comanche Moon"]}}

Surrounded by his children, who all seem to be going through life crises involving sex, drugs, and violence; his wife, Karla, who is wrestling with her own demons; and friends like Sonny, who seem to be dying, Duane can't seem to make sense of his life anymore. He gradually makes his way through a protracted end-of-life crisis of which he is finally cured by reading Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, a combination of penance and prescription from Dr. Carmichael that somehow works. Duane's Depressed is the work of a powerful, mature artist, with a deep understanding of the human condition, a profound ability to write about small-town life, and perhaps the surest touch of any American novelist for the tangled feelings that bind and separate men and women.

This memorable novel traces the arc of the two brothers livesone charismatic and macho, the other soulful and sensitivefrom Havana to New York, from East Coast clubs and dance halls to the heights of musical fame. An international bestseller and the 1990 Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love was made into a popular movie in 1992 starring Antonio Banderas and Armand Assante. With a new afterword by Oscar Hijuelos, this book has stood the test of time as a groundbreaking work of American literature. ABOUT THE AUTHOR The child of Cuban immigrants, Oscar Hijuelos (19512013) was an American-born novelist and the first Hispanic writer to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. A native New Yorker, he earned a Master of Arts in Creative Writing from the City College of New York, where he studied under Susan Sontag, Donald Barthelme, and William S. Burroughs. In addition to the Pulitzer, Hijuelos won the Rome Prize, an Ingram Merrill Foundation Award, the Hispanic Heritage Award for Literature as well as several grants from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He wrote seven novels which have been translated into more than 25 languages. Amazon.com Review Inspired by their heroes Xavier Cugat and Desi Arnaz, brothers Cesar and Nestor Castillo come to New York City from Cuba in 1949 with designs on becoming mambo stars. Eventually they do--performing with Arnaz on \"I Love Lucy\" in 1955 and recording 78s with their own band, the Mambo Kings. In his second novel, Hijuelos traces the lives of the flashy, guitar-strumming Cesar and the timid, lovelorn Nestor as they cruise the East Coast club circuit in a flamingo-pink bus. Enriching the story are the brothers' friends and family members--all driven by their own private dreams. The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990.

At the time, the latter was only available (in any language, as far as is known) in New Directions' Selected Writings of Pasternak, first published in 1949. The 1958 edition was issued with a new introduction by Babette Deutsch under the title of the book's main component, Pasternak's autobiography. Written when he was forty, Safe Conduct puzzled many readers in Russia and when it appeared in English, because its isolated sharp impressions and juxtapositions seem to deny chronology, but at least one critic recognized it as \"the most original of autobiographies, employing a new technique of great important.\" Also included is a group of remarkable short stories, translated by Robert Payne, dealing with the mysteries of life and art, and a selection of the poems that have made Pasternak known, to the few at last, as the \"outstanding Russian poet of the century.\" these are translated by the British Critic and poet C. M. Bowra, and by Miss

In The Feast of the Goat he offers a vivid re-creation of the Dominican Republic during the final days of General Rafael Trujillo's insidious and evil regime. Told from several viewpoints, the book has three distinctive, alternating strands. There is Urania Cabral, the daughter of Trujillo's disgraced secretary of state, who has returned to Santo Domingo after more than 30 years. Now a successful New York lawyer, Urania has never forgiven her aging and paralyzed father, Agust n, for literally sacrificing her to the carnal despot in the hope of regaining his political post. Flipping back to May of 1961, there is a group of assassins, all equally scarred by Trujillo, waiting to gun the Generalissimo down. Finally there is an astonishing portrait of Trujillo--the Goat--and his grotesque coterie. Llosa depicts Trujillo as a villain of Shakespearean proportions. He is a preening, macho dandy who equates his own virility with the nation's health. An admirer of Hitler \"not for his ideas but for the way he wore a uniform\" (fittingly he equips his secret police force with a fleet of black Volkswagen Beetles), Trujillo even has his own Himler in Colonel Abbes Garcia, a vicious torturer with a predilection for the occult. As the novel edges toward Trujillo's inevitable murder, Urania's story gets a bit lost in the action; the remaining narratives however, are rarely short of mesmerizing. Trujillo's death unleashes a new order, but not the one expected by the conspirators. Enslaved by the soul of the dead chief, neither they nor the Trujillo family--who embark on a hideous spree of bloody reprisals--are able to fill the void. Llosa has them all skillfully outmaneuvered by the puppet-president Joaqu n Belaguer, a former poet who is the very antithesis of the machismo Goat. Savage, touching, and bleakly funny, this compelling book gives an all too human face to one of Latin America's most destructive tyrants. --Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk From Publishers Weekly \"This wasn't an enemy he could defeat like the hundreds, the thousands he had confronted and conquered over the years, buying them, intimidating them, killing them.\" So thinks Rafael Trujillo, \"the Goat,\" dictator of the Dominican Republic, on the morning of May 30, 1961 a day that will end in his assassination. The \"enemy\" is old age at 70, Trujillo, who has always prided himself on his grooming and discipline, is shaken by bouts of incontinence and impotence. Vargas Llosa divides his narrative between three different story lines. The first concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of one of Trujillo's closest associates, Agust n Cabral. She is 14 at the time of the Trujillo assassination and, as we gradually discover, was betrayed by her father to Trujillo. Since then, she has lived in the U.S. At 49, she impulsively returns on a visit and slowly reveals the root of her alienation. Urania's character is a little too pat, however. Vargas Llosa's triumph is Trujillo's story. We follow the sly, vile despot, with his petty rages, his lust, his dealings with his avaricious family, through his last day, with mingled feelings of repulsion and awe. Like Stalin, Trujillo ruled by turning his rage without warning against his subordinates. Finally, Vargas Llosa crosscuts Urania's story and Trujillo's with that of Trujillo's assassins; first, as they wait to ambush him, and then as they are tracked down, captured and tortured to death, with almost medieval ferocity, by Trujillo's son, Ramfis. Gathering power as it rolls along, this massive, swift-moving fictional take on a grim period in Dominican history shows that Vargas Llosa is still one of the world's premier political novelists. (Nov.)Forecast: Vargas Llosa is on solid ground with The Day of the Goat, mining a rich vein. The former Peruvian presidential candidate's author tour should attract crowds, and a striking jacket will seduce browsers.

Nagel is a complete outsider, a sort of modern Christ treated in a spirit of near parody. He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the insulted and injured and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of Prussic acid. The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel's stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb3b48685135a22065d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.11,"goodreads_ratings":4547,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e609b486852b17dd691d","5c29e609b486852b17dd691e","5c29e609b486852b17dd691f","5c29e609b486852b17dd6920","5c29e609b486852b17dd6921","5c29e609b486852b17dd6922","5c29e609b486852b17dd6923","5c29e609b486852b17dd6924","5c29e609b486852b17dd6925","5c29e609b486852b17dd6926","5c29e609b486852b17dd6927","5c29e609b486852b17dd6928","5c29e609b486852b17dd6929","5c29e609b486852b17dd692a","5c29e609b486852b17dd692b","5c29e609b486852b17dd692c","5c29e609b486852b17dd692d","5c29e609b486852b17dd692e","5c29e609b486852b17dd692f","5c29e609b486852b17dd6930","5c29e609b486852b17dd6931","5c29e609b486852b17dd6932","5c29e609b486852b17dd6933","5c29e609b486852b17dd6934"],"year":"","zh_author":"汉姆生","zh_bookname":"奥秘"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.11],"goodreads_ratings":[4547],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["奥秘"],"author":["Knut Hamsun"],"zh_author":["汉姆生"],"bookname":["Mysteries"]}}

This is the central question of Camus's astonishing early novel, published posthumously and greeted as a major literary event. it tells the story of a young Algerian, Mersault, who defies society's rules by committing a murder and escaping punishment, then experimenting with different ways of life and finally dying a happy man. in many ways A Happy Death is a fascinating first sketch for The Outsider, but it can also be seen as a candid self-portrait, drawing on Camus's memories of his youth, travels and early relationships. it is infused with lyrical descriptions of the sun-drenched Algiers of his childhood - the place where, eventually, Mersault is able to find peace and die 'without anger, without hatred, without regret'.

His father's bookstore was called the Librairie de France and from this name Jacques Anatole Franois Thibault took his nom-de plume.

It informed the world that the seven wives of Bluebeard were the Dawns, and that his two brothers-in-law were the morning and the evening Twilight, identifying them with the Dioscuri, who delivered Helena when she was rapt away by Theseus.

Kamil Ruba is a tortured soul who hopes that writing the story of his life will help him gain control of it. Raised by a mother who fled her abusive husband and became overbearingly possessive and protective toward her young son, he has long been isolated emotionally and physically. Now in his twenties, Kamil seeks to escape her posthumous grasp. Finding and successfully courting the woman of his dreams seems to promise salvation, until his ignorance of mature love and his fear and jealousy lead to tragedy. Review Mahfouz is a storyteller of the first order in any idiom. Vanity Fair About the Author Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. A student of philosophy and an avid reader, his works range from reimaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Over a career that lasted more than five decades, he wrote 33 novels, 13 short story anthologies, numerous plays, and 30 screenplays. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of Palace Walk (1956), Palace of Desire (1957), and Sugar Street (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he became the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Decades ago, the idea of collective fear had a tangible face: the atom bomb. Today our shared anxiety has become far more complex and insidious, arising from tyranny, terrorism, and the invisible power of the quasi state. As Wole Soyinka suggests, the climate of fear that has enveloped the world was sparked long before September 11, 2001. Rather, it can be traced to 1989, when a passenger plane was brought down by terrorists over the Republic of Niger. From Niger to lower Manhattan to Madrid, this invisible threat has erased distinctions between citizens and soldiers; we re all potential targets now. In this seminal work, Soyinka explores the implications of this climate of fear: the conflict between power and freedom, the motives behind unthinkable acts of violence, and the meaning of human dignity. Fascinating and disturbing, Climate of Fear is a brilliant and defining work for our age. From the Trade Paperback edition.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddabb48685135a21c800.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":4,"publisher":"Random House","segments":["5c29e598b486852b17dd3532","5c29e598b486852b17dd3533","5c29e598b486852b17dd3534","5c29e598b486852b17dd3535","5c29e598b486852b17dd3536"],"year":"2005","zh_author":"沃尔索尼卡","zh_bookname":"恐惧气氛"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2005"],"zh_bookname":["恐惧气氛"],"author":["Wole Soyinka"],"zh_author":["沃尔索尼卡"],"bookname":["Climate of Fear"]}}

He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920).","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de08b48685135a23eb62.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e965b486852b17dedfe0","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe1","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe2","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe3","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe4","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe5","5c29e965b486852b17dedfe6"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 高尔斯华绥","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"正义"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["正义"],"author":["John Galsworthy"],"zh_author":["约翰 高尔斯华绥"],"bookname":["Justice"]}}

Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum s most valuable and dangerous jewel. In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.

Adapted into a critically acclaimed film by Sofia Coppola, The Virgin Suicides is a modern classic, a lyrical and timeless tale of sex and suicide that transforms and mythologizes suburban middle-American life. Jefferey Eugenides was born in Detroit and attended Brown and Stanford universities. The Virgin Suicides was published in 1993 and was adapted into a motion picture in 1999 by Sophia Coppola. His second novel, Middlesex, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003. He joined the faculty of Princeton University in the fall of 2007.

Incantatory prose . . . The narrator's hypnotic voice succeeds in transporting us to that mythic realm where fate, not common sense or psychology, holds sway. By turns lyrical and portentous, ferocious and elegiac, The Virgin Suicides insinuates itself into our minds as a small but powerful opera in the unexpected form of a novel.\" Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times\"Mr. Eugenides is blessed with the storyteller's most magical gift, the ability to transform the mundane into the extraordinary.\" Suzanne Berne, The New York Times Book Review\"Arresting . . . uncannily evokes the wry voice of adolescence and a mixture of curiosity, lust, tenderness, morbidity, cynicism, and the na vet surrounding these bizarre events.\" The Wall Street Journal\"[A] comic and elegiac first novel . . . Eugenides is one of those rare writers who can manage sympathy and detachment simultaneously and work small wonders with words while he's at it. As The Virgin Suicides puts its heroines through hell, its readers, weirdly enough, will be delighted.\" David Gates, Newsweek\"The Virgin Suicides takes the dark stuff of Greek tragedy and reworks it into an eccentric, mesmerizing, frequently hilarious American fantasy about the tyranny of unrequited love, and the unknowable heart of every family on earth but especially the family next door . . . There's much here that's marvelously original, and like Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus or Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club, this is one of those debuts that tell you you are present at the beginning of a major career and make you glad you own a first edition.\" Tom De Haven, Entertainment Weekly\"Rhapsodic . . . With a deft, often comedic touch, Eugenides examines the concept of mass suicide in a way that might, in less assured hands, strain a reader's credulity. By skillfully displaying the parents' inability to succor the grief of their surviving daughters and by showing a father 'with the lost look of a man who realized that all this dying was going to be all the life he ever had,' the author makes the reader understand the lemminglike conduct of a group of adolescent siblings. By turns hypnotic and elegiac, the novel manages to sustain a high level of suspense in what is clearly an impressive debut.\" People\"Eugenides's remarkable first novel opens on a startling note: 'On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicide . . . the two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was, and the gas oven, and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to tie a rope.' What follows is not, however, a horror novel, but a finely crafted work of literary if slightly macabre imagination. In an unnamed town in the slightly distant past, detailed in such precise and limpid prose that readers will surely feel that they grew up there, Cecilia the youngest and most obviously wacky of the luscious Lisbon girls finally succeeds in taking her own life. As the confused neighbors watch rather helplessly, the remaining sisters become isolated and unhinged, ending it all in a spectacular multiple suicide anticipated from the first page. Eugenides's engrossing writing style keeps one reading despite a creepy feeling that one shouldn't be enjoying it so much. A black, glittering novel.\" Barbara Hoffert, Library Journal\"Eugenides's tantalizing, macabre first novel begins with a suicide, the first of the five bizarre deaths of the teenage daughters in the Lisbon family; the rest of the work, set in the author's native Michigan in the early 1970s, is a backward-looking quest as the male narrator and his nosy, horny pals describe how they strove to understand the odd clan of this first chapter, which appeared in the Paris Review, where it won the 1991 Aga Khan Prize for fiction . . .Eugenides's voice is so fresh and compelling, his powers of observation so startling and acute, that most will be mesmerized. The title derives from a song by the fictional rock band Cruel Crux, a favorite of the Lisbon daughter Lux who, unlike her sisters Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia, is anything but a virgin by the tale's end. Her mother forces Lux to burn the album along with others she considers dangerously provocative. Mr. Lisbon, a mild-mannered high school math teacher, is driven to resign by parents who believe his control of their children may be as deficient as his control of his own brood . . . Under the narrator's goofy, posturing banter are some hard truths: mortality is a fact of life; teenage girls are more attracted to brawn than to brains (contrary to the testimony of the narrator's male relatives). This is an auspicious debut from an imaginative and talented writer.\" Publishers Weekly","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd94b48685135a211e19.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.84,"goodreads_ratings":200016,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e473b486852b17dcb743","5c29e473b486852b17dcb744","5c29e473b486852b17dcb745","5c29e473b486852b17dcb746","5c29e473b486852b17dcb747","5c29e473b486852b17dcb748","5c29e473b486852b17dcb749","5c29e473b486852b17dcb74a","5c29e473b486852b17dcb74b","5c29e473b486852b17dcb74c"],"year":"1990","zh_author":"杰弗里 尤金尼德斯","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"处女自杀"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.84],"goodreads_ratings":[200016],"year":["1990"],"zh_bookname":["处女自杀"],"author":["Jeffrey Eugenides"],"zh_author":["杰弗里 尤金尼德斯"],"bookname":["The Virgin Suicides"]}}

Based on interviews, records of court proceedings, newspaper stories, and various other documents, it covers the nine months between Gilmore's parole from prison, his final crime, and his execution. The blurring of the distinction between fiction and nonfiction was one of the central developments of postwar American literature, and Mailer's imaginative use of the facts is an extension of his earlier forays into the \"new journalism.\" He re-creates Gillmore's tormented psyche, recounts his crimes, takes in the story of Mormonism and the history of Utah, introduces Uncle Vern, Aunt Ida, victims, cops, cons, guards, lovers, and lawyers. The \"Western Voices\" of small-town America and the \"Eastern Voices\" of the journalists and show-biz types who descend on the Gilmore story are fused into a remarkable chorus, amplifying the presence of Gilmore himself, a smart, funny, doomed man - one of the most complex characters in modern letters.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dda4b48685135a2199c7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e54fb486852b17dd1398","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1399","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139a","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139b","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139c","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139d","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139e","5c29e54fb486852b17dd139f","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a0","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ac","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ba","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13bb","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13bc","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13bd","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13be","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13bf","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c0","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13c9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ca","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13cb","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13cc","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13cd","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ce","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13cf","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d0","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13d9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13da","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13db","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13dc","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13dd","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13de","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13df","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e0","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13e9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ea","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13eb","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ec","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ed","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ee","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ef","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f0","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f1","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13f9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13fa","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13fb","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13fc","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13fd","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13fe","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ff","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1400","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1401","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1402","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1403","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1404","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1405","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1406","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1407","5c29e54fb486852b17dd1408","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a2","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a3","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a4","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a5","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a6","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a7","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a8","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13a9","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13aa","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ab","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ad","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13ae","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13af","5c29e54fb486852b17dd13b0"],"year":"1979","zh_author":"梅勒","zh_bookname":"刽子手之歌"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1979"],"zh_bookname":["刽子手之歌"],"author":["Norman Mailer"],"zh_author":["梅勒"],"bookname":["The Executioner's Song"]}}

So it seems only fitting that Norman Mailer the literary provocateur who altered the landscape of American nonfiction wrote the most wide-ranging, far-seeing chronicle of the Apollo 11 mission. A classic chronicle of America s reach for greatness in the midst of the Cold War, Of a Fire on the Moon compiles the reportage Mailer published between 1969 and 1970 in Life magazine: gripping firsthand dispatches from inside NASA s clandestine operations in Houston and Cape Kennedy; technical insights into the magnitude of their awe-inspiring feat; and prescient meditations that place the event in human context as only Mailer could.

In a span of more than six decades, Mailer has searched into subjects ranging from World War II to Ancient Egypt, from the march on the Pentagon to Marilyn Monroe, from Henry Miller and Mohammad Ali to Jesus Christ. Now, in The Castle in the Forest, his first major work of fiction in more than a decade, Mailer offers what may be his consummate literary endeavor: He has set out to explore the evil of Adolf Hitler. The narrator, a mysterious SS man who is later revealed to be an exceptional presence, gives us young Adolf from birth, as well as Hitler's father and mother, his sisters and brothers, and the intimate details of his childhood and adolescence. A tapestry of unforgettable characters, The Castle in the Forest delivers its playful twists and surprises with astonishing insight into the nature of the struggle between good and evil that exists in us all. At its core is a hypothesis that propels this novel and makes it a work of stunning originality. Now, on the eve of his eighty-fourth birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de0ab48685135a23fa8d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.14,"goodreads_ratings":2560,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e986b486852b17deebd3","5c29e986b486852b17deebd4","5c29e986b486852b17deebd5","5c29e986b486852b17deebd6","5c29e986b486852b17deebd7","5c29e986b486852b17deebd8","5c29e986b486852b17deebd9","5c29e986b486852b17deebda","5c29e986b486852b17deebdb","5c29e986b486852b17deebdc","5c29e986b486852b17deebdd","5c29e986b486852b17deebde","5c29e986b486852b17deebdf","5c29e986b486852b17deebe0","5c29e986b486852b17deebe1","5c29e986b486852b17deebe2","5c29e986b486852b17deebe3","5c29e986b486852b17deebe4","5c29e986b486852b17deebe5","5c29e986b486852b17deebe6","5c29e986b486852b17deebe7","5c29e986b486852b17deebe8","5c29e986b486852b17deebe9","5c29e986b486852b17deebea","5c29e986b486852b17deebeb","5c29e986b486852b17deebec","5c29e986b486852b17deebed","5c29e986b486852b17deebee","5c29e986b486852b17deebef","5c29e986b486852b17deebf0","5c29e986b486852b17deebf1","5c29e986b486852b17deebf2","5c29e986b486852b17deebf3","5c29e986b486852b17deebf4","5c29e986b486852b17deebf5","5c29e986b486852b17deebf6","5c29e986b486852b17deebf7","5c29e986b486852b17deebf8","5c29e986b486852b17deebf9","5c29e986b486852b17deebfa"],"year":"1989","zh_author":"梅勒","zh_bookname":"森林中的城堡"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.14],"goodreads_ratings":[2560],"year":["1989"],"zh_bookname":["森林中的城堡"],"author":["Norman Mailer"],"zh_author":["梅勒"],"bookname":["The Castle in the Forest"]}}

Into this nightmare world of depravity arrives Sergius O'Shaughnessy, recently discharged from the Air Force, traumatised by his ar experiences and trying to write the Great American Novel. But O'Shaughnessy's burning ambition begins to lose its edge; lured by greed and rules by weakness, he soon becomes disturbingly familiar with the dnagerous life of slick compromises and sexual follies... The Deer Park is a powerful and vigorous satire on Hollywood's excesses and corruption.

It is also one of the best.\"-- The New York Times \"The best novel to have ever come out of the South...it is unsurpassed in the whole of American writing.\"-- The Washington Post \"Fascinating and unforgettable! A remarkable book, a spectacular book, a book that will not be forgotten!\"-- Chicago Tribune \"_Gone with the Wind_ is one of those rare books that we never forget. We read it when we're young and fall in love with the characters, then we watch the film and read the book again and watch the film again and never get tired of revisiting an era that is the most important in our history. Rhett and Scarlet and Melanie and Ashley and Big Sam and Mammy and Archie the convict are characters who always remain with us, in the same way that Twain's characters do. No one ever forgets the scene when Scarlet wanders among the wounded in the Atlanta train yard; no one ever forgets the moment Melanie and Scarlet drag the body of the dead Federal soldier down the staircase, a step at a time. Gone with the Wind is an epic story. Anyone who has not read it has missed one of the greatest literary experiences a reader can have.\"-- James Lee Burke, bestselling author of The Tin Roof Blowdown \"I first read Gone with the Wind in grade school--a boy of the upper South who'd seen the great movie and felt compelled to learn what lay behind it, all thousand-plus pages worth. No page disappointed me. What other American novel surpasses its eagerness to tell a great story of love and war; what characters equal the cantankerous passions of Scarlett and Rhett? Even Scott Fitzgerald spoke well of it. What more could I ask, even seven decades later?\"-- Reynolds Price \"In my own personal life, I find many similarities to Scarlett's: The whole 17-inch waist thing notwithstanding, I do love a barbecue, both for the food and the men--I have been known to \"eat like a field hand and gobble like a hawg\"--I admit that at least on one occasion I may have feigned interest in some guy to further my own interests--I have fought tooth, toenail and tirelessly for my family--I learn slow but I learn good--and even so, I still adore the prospect of dealing with most things...Tomorrow.\"-- Jill Conner Browne, The Sweet Potato Queen, bestselling author of The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel \"In 1936 I was in E.M. Daggett Junior High in Ft. Worth, Texas. By some chance I was able to read Gone with the Wind early on. Then and now, I found it one of the great experiences of a young life. I still list it as one of my 10 favorite books.\"-- Liz Smith, nationally syndicated columnist \"Not just a great love story, Gone with the Wind is one of the most powerful anti-war novels ever written. Told from the standpoint of the women left behind, author Margaret Mitchell brilliantly illustrates the heartbreaking and devastating effects of war on the land and its people.\" -- Fannie Flagg, Academy Award nominated-author \"Let's say you've read Gone with the Wind at least twice, and seen the movie over and again. So, here's a thought. Buy this handsome paperback edition, just for Pat Conroy's preface. This passionate, nearly breathless love letter is a Song of Solomon to Margaret Mitchell, Scarlett O'Hara, and Conroy's beautiful, GTW-obsessed mother. Indeed, his luminous preface packs a durable wallop, just like the epic Pulitzer prize-winning work that inspires it.\"-- Jan Karon, author of The Mitford Years series \"GWTW is an indelible portrait of a unique time and place, American's greatest political and moral conflict, and the myths that surround it -- an all absorbing spectacle of a read even for postmodern readers. Mitchell vividly portrays the disillusionment and devastation of war, the ignorance of the uninitiated, and the transformation of arrogance into tenacity that shaped the first \"new South.\" All the details of history and place come together as a rich backdrop for those unforgettable characters: shallow and selfish Scarlett, sincere Melanie, moony-eyed Ashley, and the sage, pragmatic, dashing, and rakish Rhett Butler--the most enduring heartthrob of American literature has produced. I'd reread the book for the thrill of Rhett alone!\" -- Darnell Arnoult, author of Sufficient Grace Product Description Margaret Mitchell's epic novel of love and war won the Pulitzer Prize and went on to give rise to two authorized sequels and one of the most popular and celebrated movies of all time. Many novels have been written about the Civil War and its aftermath. None take us into the burning fields and cities of the American South as Gone With the Wind does, creating haunting scenes and thrilling portraits of characters so vivid that we remember their words and feel their fear and hunger for the rest of our lives.

This amazing eBook collection is the perfect companion, whether you re spending the day at the beach or a quiet evening in your own backyard. BREATHING LESSONS Anne Tyler Winner of the Pulitzer Prize A wonderful novel, glowing with the insight and compassion of an artist s touch. The *Boston Globe Maggie and Ira Moran have been married for twenty-eight years and it shows: in their quarrels, in their routines, in their ability to tolerate with affection each other s eccentricities. Maggie is a kooky, lovable optimist who wants nothing more than to fix her son s broken marriage, while Ira is infuriatingly practical. When what begins as a day trip to a funeral becomes an adventure in the unexpected, Maggie and Ira must navigate the riotous twists and turns. Together they rediscover the magic of the road called life and the joy of having somebody to share the ride with, bumps and all. THE ALPHABET SISTERS Monica McInerney * Charm, laughter, and tears . . . a delightful story that shows how quarrels can be solved with love and loyalty. Woman s Day As girls growing up in the Clare Valley, Australia, Anna, Bett, and Carrie Quinlan were childhood singing stars known as the Alphabet Sisters. As adults, though, the women haven t spoken in years ever since Bett s fianc deserted her to marry the younger Carrie. But now their flamboyant grandmother Lola is turning eighty, and she is determined to reunite the girls for a blowout bash. And no one ever says no to Lola. The women s short visit becomes a much longer commitment when an unexpected turn of events changes everything in ways none of them could ever have imagined. FIREFLY SUMMER Maeve Binchy The best Binchy yet. The New York Times Book Review ** Kate Ryan and her husband, John, have a rollicking pub in the Irish village of Mountfern, four lovely children, and such wonderful dreams. Then American millionaire Patrick O Neill comes to town to build a grand hotel, with its promise of wealth and change. As love and hate vie for a town s quiet heart, loyalties are challenged, jealousies ignited, and old traditions begin to crumble away.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de01b48685135a23b2e4.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.7,"goodreads_ratings":10,"level":2,"publisher":"Ballantine Books","segments":["5c29e905b486852b17deb743","5c29e905b486852b17deb744","5c29e905b486852b17deb745","5c29e905b486852b17deb746","5c29e905b486852b17deb747","5c29e905b486852b17deb748","5c29e905b486852b17deb749","5c29e905b486852b17deb74a","5c29e905b486852b17deb74b","5c29e905b486852b17deb74c","5c29e905b486852b17deb74d","5c29e905b486852b17deb74e","5c29e905b486852b17deb74f","5c29e905b486852b17deb750","5c29e905b486852b17deb751","5c29e905b486852b17deb752","5c29e905b486852b17deb753","5c29e905b486852b17deb754","5c29e905b486852b17deb755","5c29e905b486852b17deb756","5c29e905b486852b17deb757","5c29e905b486852b17deb758","5c29e905b486852b17deb759","5c29e905b486852b17deb75a","5c29e905b486852b17deb75b","5c29e905b486852b17deb75c","5c29e905b486852b17deb75d","5c29e905b486852b17deb75e","5c29e905b486852b17deb75f","5c29e905b486852b17deb760","5c29e905b486852b17deb761","5c29e905b486852b17deb762","5c29e905b486852b17deb763","5c29e905b486852b17deb764","5c29e905b486852b17deb765","5c29e905b486852b17deb766","5c29e905b486852b17deb767","5c29e905b486852b17deb768","5c29e905b486852b17deb769","5c29e905b486852b17deb76a","5c29e905b486852b17deb76b","5c29e905b486852b17deb76c","5c29e905b486852b17deb76d","5c29e905b486852b17deb76e","5c29e905b486852b17deb76f","5c29e905b486852b17deb770","5c29e905b486852b17deb771","5c29e905b486852b17deb772","5c29e905b486852b17deb773","5c29e905b486852b17deb774","5c29e905b486852b17deb775","5c29e905b486852b17deb776","5c29e905b486852b17deb777","5c29e905b486852b17deb778","5c29e905b486852b17deb779","5c29e905b486852b17deb77a","5c29e905b486852b17deb77b","5c29e905b486852b17deb77c","5c29e905b486852b17deb77d","5c29e905b486852b17deb77e","5c29e905b486852b17deb77f","5c29e905b486852b17deb780"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"安妮泰勒","zh_bookname":"沙滩书包"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.7],"goodreads_ratings":[10],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["沙滩书包"],"author":["Anne Tyler"],"zh_author":["安妮泰勒"],"bookname":["The Beach Book Bundle"]}}

The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage.

He was born to Italian immigrant parents (the family name was originally spelled Sciarra, which in Italian is pronounced the same way) in Jersey City, New Jersey, graduated from Rutgers University in 1951, and served as a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne division prior to the Korean War. Before Shaara began selling science fiction stories to fiction magazines in the 1950s, he was an amateur boxer and police officer. He later taught literature at Florida State University while continuing to write fiction. The stress of this and his smoking caused him to have a heart attack at the early age of 36; from which he fully recovered. His novel about the Battle of Gettysburg, The Killer Angels , won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1975. Shaara died of another heart attack in 1988. Shaara's son, Jeffrey Shaara, is also a popular writer of historical fiction; most notably sequels to his father's best-known novel. His most famous is the prequel to The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals . Jeffrey was the one to finally get Michael's last book, For Love of the Game , published three years after he died.

Profoundly dark, told in spare, searing prose, The Road is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece, one of the best books we've read this year, but in case you need a second (and expert) opinion, we asked Dennis Lehane, author of equally rich, occasionally bleak and brutal novels, to read it and give us his take. Read his glowing review below. --Daphne Durham Guest Reviewer: Dennis Lehane Dennis Lehane, master of the hard-boiled thriller, generated a cult following with his series about private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, wowed readers with the intense and gut-wrenching Mystic River , blew fans all away with the mind-bending Shutter Island , and switches gears with Coronado , his new collection of gritty short stories (and one play). Cormac McCarthy sets his new novel, The Road , in a post-apocalyptic blight of gray skies that drizzle ash, a world in which all matter of wildlife is extinct, starvation is not only prevalent but nearly all-encompassing, and marauding bands of cannibals roam the environment with pieces of human flesh stuck between their teeth. If this sounds oppressive and dispiriting, it is. McCarthy may have just set to paper the definitive vision of the world after nuclear war, and in this recent age of relentless saber-rattling by the global powers, it's not much of a leap to feel his vision could be not far off the mark nor, sadly, right around the corner. Stealing across this horrific (and that's the only word for it) landscape are an unnamed man and his emaciated son, a boy probably around the age of ten. It is the love the father feels for his son, a love as deep and acute as his grief, that could surprise readers of McCarthy's previous work. McCarthy's Gnostic impressions of mankind have left very little place for love. In fact that greatest love affair in any of his novels, I would argue, occurs between the Billy Parham and the wolf in The Crossing . But here the love of a desperate father for his sickly son transcends all else. McCarthy has always written about the battle between light and darkness; the darkness usually comprises 99.9% of the world, while any illumination is the weak shaft thrown by a penlight running low on batteries. In The Road , those batteries are almost out--the entire world is, quite literally, dying--so the final affirmation of hope in the novel's closing pages is all the more shocking and maybe all the more enduring as the boy takes all of his father's (and McCarthy's) rage at the hopeless folly of man and lays it down, lifting up, in its place, the oddest of all things: faith. --Dennis Lehane The Road is now a major motion picture based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, starring Academy Award-nominee Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Enjoy these images from the film, and click the thumbnails to see larger images. From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Violence, in McCarthy's postapocalyptic tour de force, has been visited worldwide in the form of a \"long shear of light and then a series of low concussions\" that leaves cities and forests burned, birds and fish dead and the earth shrouded in gray clouds of ash. In this landscape, an unnamed man and his young son journey down a road to get to the sea. (The man's wife, who gave birth to the boy after calamity struck, has killed herself.) They carry blankets and scavenged food in a shopping cart, and the man is armed with a revolver loaded with his last two bullets. Beyond the ever-present possibility of starvation lies the threat of roving bands of cannibalistic thugs. The man assures the boy that the two of them are \"good guys,\" but from the way his father treats other stray survivors the boy sees that his father has turned into an amoral survivalist, tenuously attached to the morality of the past by his fierce love for his son. McCarthy establishes himself here as the closest thing in American literature to an Old Testament prophet, trolling the blackest registers of human emotion to create a haunting and grim novel about civilization's slow death after the power goes out. 250,000 announced first printing; BOMC main selection.

At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering under extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes a bawdy joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king s hangman. In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as Iceland s Sun, a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen. As their personal struggle plays itself out on an international stage, Iceland s Bell creates a Dickensian canvas of heroism and venality, violence and tragedy, charged with narrative enchantment on every page.

The indifference and contempt of most of the people around him only reinforces his sense of destiny, for in Iceland poets are as likely to be scorned as they are to be revered. Over the ensuing years, Olaf comes to lead the paradigmatic poet s life of poverty, loneliness, ruinous love affairs and sexual scandal. But he will never attain anything like greatness. As imagined by Nobel Prize winner Halldor Laxness in this magnificently humane novel, what might be cruel farce achieves pathos and genuine exaltation. For as Olaf s ambition drives him onward and into the orbits of an unstable spiritualist, a shady entrepreneur, and several susceptible women World Light demonstrates how the creative spirit can survive in even the most crushing environment and even the most unpromising human vessel.

Translated from Bengali to English, these stories depict the human condition in its many forms: innocence and childhood, love and loss, the city and the village, the natural and the supernatural. Prominent among the stories are the famous The Cabuliwallah, which has also been adapted as a movie. The book also gives an insight into the socio-economic conditions prevalent in Colonial Bengal.The language is rich and the narrative compelling. Tagore was one of the greatest poets of the twentieth Century, and that lyrical quality comes through in all of his work. About Rabindra Nath Tagore: Rabindranath Tagore[a] (Listeni/r bindr n t t r/; Bengali pronunciation: [robind ro nat akur]), also written Rav ndran tha Th kura (7 May 1861 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev,[c] was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of the modern Indian subcontinent.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb2b48685135a21ffe3.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.86,"goodreads_ratings":253,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b4","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b5","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b6","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b7","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b8","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62b9","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62ba","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62bb","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62bc","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62bd","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62be","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62bf","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c0","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c1","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c2","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c3","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c4","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c5","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c6","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c7","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c8","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62c9","5c29e5fcb486852b17dd62ca"],"year":"","zh_author":"泰戈尔","zh_bookname":"泰戈尔的故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.86],"goodreads_ratings":[253],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["泰戈尔的故事"],"author":["Rabindranath Tagore"],"zh_author":["泰戈尔"],"bookname":["Stories from Tagore"]}}

Upon his return to his native Budapest still clad in his striped prison clothes, fourteen-year-old George Koves senses the indifference, even hostility, of people on the street. His former neighbors and friends urge him to put the ordeal out of his mind, while a sympathetic journalist refers to the camps as \"the lowest circle of hell.\" The boy can relate to neither cliche and is left to ponder the meaning of his experience alone.George's response to his experience is curiously ambivalent. In the camps he tries to adjust to his ever-worsening situation by imputing human motives to his inhumane captors. By imposing his logic--that of a bright, sensitive, though in many ways ordinary teenager - he maintains a precarious semblance of normalcy. Once freed, he must contend with the \"banality of evil\" to which he has become accustomed: when asked why he uses words like \"naturally,\" \"undeniably,\" and \"without question\" to describe the most horrendous of experiences, he responds, \"In the concentration camp it was natural.\" Without emotional or spiritual ties to his Jewish heritage and rejected by his country, he ultimately comes to the conclusion that neither his Hungarianness nor his Jewishness was really at the heart of his fate: rather, there are only \"given situations, and within these, further givens.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62e6c8b486851436610bb0.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.05,"goodreads_ratings":6458,"level":5,"publisher":"Tandem Library","segments":["5c29ef63b486852f6a6814b9","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814ba","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814bb","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814bc","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814bd","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814be","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814bf","5c29ef63b486852f6a6814c0"],"year":"2004","zh_author":"凯尔泰斯","zh_bookname":"无效性"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.05],"goodreads_ratings":[6458],"year":["2004"],"zh_bookname":["无效性"],"author":["Imre Kertesz"],"zh_author":["凯尔泰斯"],"bookname":["Fatelessness"]}}

He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade.

As he delves into the emotions of the German commander and the Norwegian traitor, and depicts the spirited patriotism of the Norwegian underground, Steinbeck uncovers profound, often unsettling truths about warand about human nature. Nobel Prize winner John Steinbecks self-described celebration of the durability of democracy had an extraordinary impact as Allied propaganda in Nazi-occupied Europe. Despite Axis efforts to suppress it (in Fascist Italy, mere possession of the book was punishable by death), The Moon is Down was secretly translated into French, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, German, Italian and Russian; hundreds of thousands of copies circulated throughout Europe, making it by far the most popular piece of propaganda under the occupation. Few literary works of our time have demonstrated so triumphantly the power of ideas in the face of cold steel and brute force. This edition features an introduction by Donald V.

With the inquisitiveness of an investigative reporter and the emotional power of a novelist in his prime, Steinbeck toured the squatters' camps and Hoovervilles of California. Here he found once strong, independent farmers the backbone of rural America so reduced in dignity, beaten in spirit, sick, sullen, and defeated that they had been \"cast down to a kind of subhumanity.\" He contrasts their misery with the hope offered by government resettlement camps, where self-help committees, child nurseries, quilting and sewing projects, and decent sanitation were restoring dignity and indeed saving lives. _The Harvest Gypsies_ gives us an eyewitness account of the horrendous Dust Bowl migration, a major event in California history, and provides the factual foundation for Steinbeck's masterpiece, _The Grapes of Wrath_. Included are twenty-two photographs by Dorothea Lange and others, many of which accompanied Steinbeck's original articles.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddf4b48685135a235a55.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.83,"goodreads_ratings":610,"level":3,"publisher":"Heyday Books","segments":["5c29e846b486852b17de71ed","5c29e846b486852b17de71ee","5c29e846b486852b17de71ef","5c29e846b486852b17de71f0","5c29e846b486852b17de71f1","5c29e846b486852b17de71f2","5c29e846b486852b17de71f3","5c29e846b486852b17de71f4","5c29e846b486852b17de71f5","5c29e846b486852b17de71f6","5c29e846b486852b17de71f7","5c29e846b486852b17de71f8","5c29e846b486852b17de71f9","5c29e846b486852b17de71fa","5c29e846b486852b17de71fb","5c29e846b486852b17de71fc","5c29e846b486852b17de71fd","5c29e846b486852b17de71fe","5c29e846b486852b17de71ff","5c29e846b486852b17de7200","5c29e846b486852b17de7201","5c29e846b486852b17de7202","5c29e846b486852b17de7203","5c29e846b486852b17de7204","5c29e846b486852b17de7205","5c29e846b486852b17de7206","5c29e846b486852b17de7207","5c29e846b486852b17de7208"],"year":"2002","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"收获吉普赛人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.83],"goodreads_ratings":[610],"year":["2002"],"zh_bookname":["收获吉普赛人"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["The Harvest Gypsies"]}}

When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.\" Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression, To Kill a Mockingbird follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up. Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from Dracula and plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind \"when you really see them.\" By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill a Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often. --Alix Wilber From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Lee's beloved American classics makes its belated debut on audio (after briefly being available in the 1990s for the blind and libraries through Books on Tape) with the kind of classy packaging that may spoil listeners for all other audiobooks. The two CD slipcases housing the 11 discs not only feature art mirroring Mary Schuck's cover design but also offers helpful track listings for each disk. Many viewers of the 1962 movie adaptation believe that Lee was the film's narrator, but it was actually an unbilled Kim Stanley who read a mere six passages and left an indelible impression. Competing with Stanley's memory, Spacek forges her own path to a victorious reading. Spacek reads with a slight Southern lilt and quiet authority. Told entirely from the perspective of young Scout Finch, there's no need for Spacek to create individual voices for various characters but she still invests them all with emotion. Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning 1960 novel, which quietly stands as one of the most powerful statements of the Civil Rights movement, has been superbly brought to audio.

It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate. Amazon.com Review An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013: It's hard to articulate just how much--and why-- The Goldfinch held such power for me as a reader. Always a sucker for a good boy-and-his-mom story, I probably was taken in at first by the cruelly beautiful passages in which 13-year-old Theo Decker tells of the accident that killed his beloved mother and set his fate. But even when the scene shifts--first Theo goes to live with his schoolmates picture-perfect (except it isnt) family on Park Avenue, then to Las Vegas with his father and his trashy wife, then back to a New York antiques shop--I remained mesmerized. Along with Boris, Theos Ukrainian high school sidekick, and Hobie, one of the most wonderfully eccentric characters in modern literature, Theo--strange, grieving, effete, alcoholic and often not close to honorable Theo--had taken root in my heart. Still, The Goldfinch is more than a 700-plus page turner about a tragic loss: its also a globe-spanning mystery about a painting that has gone missing, an examination of friendship, and a rumination on the nature of art and appearances. Most of all, it is a sometimes operatic, often unnerving and always moving chronicle of a certain kind of life. Things would have turned out better if she had lived, Theo said of his mother, fourteen years after she died. An understatement if ever there was one, but one that makes the selfish reader cry out: Oh, but then we wouldnt have had this brilliant book! --Sara Nelson From Publishers Weekly Donna Tartt's latest novel clocks in at an unwieldy 784 pages. The story begins with an explosion at the Metropolitan Museum that kills narrator Theo Decker's beloved mother and results in his unlikely possession of a Dutch masterwork called The Goldfinch. Shootouts, gangsters, pillowcases, storage lockers, and the black market for art all play parts in the ensuing life of the painting in Theo's care. With the same flair for suspense that made The Secret History (1992) such a masterpiece, The Goldfinch features the pulp of a typical bildungsromanTheo's dissolution into teenage delinquency and climb back out, his passionate friendship with the very funny Boris, his obsession with Pippa (a girl he first encounters minutes before the explosion)but the painting is the novel's secret heart. Theo's fate hinges on the painting, and both take on depth as it steers Theo's life. Some sentences are clunky (suddenly and meanwhile abound), metaphors are repetitive (Theo's mother is compared to birds three times in 10 pages), and plot points are overly coincidental (as if inspired by TV), but there's a bewitching urgency to the narration that's impossible to resist. Theo is magnetic, perhaps because of his well-meaning criminality. The Goldfinch is a pleasure to read; with more economy to the brushstrokes, it might have been great. Agent: Amanda Urban, ICM.

A family from the United States goes to the remote Sierras in Mexico--the writer-to-be, Susannah; her sister, Magdalena; her father and mother. And there, amid an endangered band of mixed-race Blacks and Indians called the Mundo, they begin an encounter that will change them more than they could ever dream. Moving back and forth in time, and among unforgettable characters and their stories, Walker crosses conventional borders of all kinds as she explores in this magical novel the ways in which a woman's denied sexuality leads to the loss of the much prized and necessary original self; and how she regains that self, even as her family's past of lies and love is transformed. By the Light of My Father's Smile presents, as Alice Walker puts it, \"a celebration of sexuality, its absolute usefulness in the accessing of one's mature spirituality, and the father's role in assuring joy or sorrow in this arena for his female children.\" It explores the richness and coherence of alternative culture, experience of sexuality as a celebration of life, of trust in Nature and the Spirit, even as it affirms the belief, as Walker says, \"that it is the triumphant heart, not the conquered heart, that forgives. And that love is both timeless and beyond time.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3db48685135a1f045e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"San Val","segments":["5c29e09db486852b17db0d26","5c29e09db486852b17db0d27","5c29e09db486852b17db0d28","5c29e09db486852b17db0d29","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2a","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2b","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2c","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2d","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2e","5c29e09db486852b17db0d2f","5c29e09db486852b17db0d30","5c29e09db486852b17db0d31","5c29e09db486852b17db0d32","5c29e09db486852b17db0d33","5c29e09db486852b17db0d34","5c29e09db486852b17db0d35","5c29e09db486852b17db0d36","5c29e09db486852b17db0d37","5c29e09db486852b17db0d38"],"year":"1998","zh_author":"爱丽丝沃克","zh_bookname":"借着父亲微笑的光芒"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1998"],"zh_bookname":["借着父亲微笑的光芒"],"author":["Alice Walker"],"zh_author":["爱丽丝沃克"],"bookname":["By the Light of My Father's Smile"]}}

His fictional examination of this unusual phenomenon starts with the dying 31-year-old Henry Townsend, a former slave-now master of 33 slaves of his own and more than 50 acres of land in Manchester County, Va.-worried about the fate of his holdings upon his early death. As a slave in his youth, Henry makes himself indispensable to his master, William Robbins. Even after Henry's parents purchase the family's freedom, Henry retains his allegiance to Robbins, who patronizes him when he sets up shop as a shoemaker and helps him buy his first slaves and his plantation. Jones's thorough knowledge of the legal and social intricacies of slaveholding allows him to paint a complex, often startling picture of life in the region. His richest characterizations-of Robbins and Henry-are particularly revealing. Though he is a cruel master to his slaves, Robbins is desperately in love with a black woman and feels as much fondness for Henry as for his own children; Henry, meanwhile, reads Milton, but beats his slaves as readily as Robbins does. Henry's wife, Caldonia, is not as disciplined as her husband, and when he dies, his worst fears are realized: the plantation falls into chaos. Jones's prose can be rather static and his phrasings ponderous, but his narrative achieves crushing momentum through sheer accumulation of detail, unusual historical insight and generous character writing.

Perhaps it is more important in our current cultural climate than ever before. It is the story of the lone individual, lost in the ironic good fortune and security of bourgeois banality and cultural conformity. The central character, Harry Haller, has all the insight, all the leisure, all the material goods he needs, yet he is not at peace with his life. His physical ailments are but symptoms of his true crisis, that of a lost soul, that of a life without meaning, that of a human without a love of humanity. Haller, like many of us, is torn in two by his love of comfort and safety, on the one hand, and his deeper drive for a more authentically creative existence on the other. His tragic situation is born out of his inability to translate his blessings into love. Before his magical journey of discovery begins, he is nearly consumed by an almost suicidal paralysis in the face of that added dimension of existence which would bring it spiritual meaning. Make no mistake, Steppenwolf is not a light read. Yet the escape it provides from the pabulum of today's entertainment is a welcome reminder of that something more to be found in human experience. We do not all suffer from the same issues that Harry does, over-intellectualization and self-exile from society. But many of us feel a similar need to explore life's depths in the midst of a culture that rarely sheds light upon the inner path. What Hesse offers us all is a potent combination of eastern and western insights into the human search for meaning. Among the themes he successfully weaves together into a universal fabric are Nietzschean philosophy, depth psychology, and Buddhism. Over the course of his narrative, Hesse s main character and alter-ego experiences his over-analyzed but poorly understood self through the lens of life's great paradoxes. Thus, the storyline swirls through sensuality to find spirit, it dismantles the personality to promote a greater synthesis, and it bridges the divide between the temporal and eternal. For this reason, Steppenwolf is still the kind of literature which can enrich the individual experience by pointing us back toward that added dimension. Read it, and you are invited on journey of renewal, on a quest for meaning in an age in which such is increasingly hard to find. It is our good fortune to have this new translation of the work from Dr. Thomas Wayne. As he shows in his work here, there must be a proper balance of faithfulness to both the style and substance of the original. Basil Creighton s 1929 translation of Steppenwolf into English, and the 1963 revision based upon it, simply omit certain elements. In these earlier, bowdlerized versions, precision has been unduly sacrificed to readability. Dr. Wayne succeeds in giving the reader as much of Hesse s actual language, in both its rhythm and its content, as a translation can allow. Now is the time to either discover or revisit this early twentieth-century classic. --Dr. Russell H. Swanson Product Description Hesse's classic story, a potent combination of Eastern and Western insights into the human search for meaning, raises issues that are perhaps more important in our current cultural climate than ever before. Steppenwolf, first published in German in 1927, is given new life in this fresh translation. Thomas Wayne presents a contemporary take on the lone individual lost in the ironic good fortune and security of bourgeois banality and cultural conformity. Harry Haller, the hero, has all the insight, all the leisure, all the material goods he needs, yet he is not at peace with his life and decides to commit suicide. Then Hermine and her friends open to him the countless pathways of self-discovery. Basil Creighton's 1929 translation (revised in 1963 by Joseph Mileck) is the best-known version in English; it skips words, smoothes out long, involved passages, unnecessarily improves the text all things Thomas Wayne refuses to do. He emphasizes a strict adherence and reverence for the literal -- a Hesse for the 21st century, meaningful and faithful to the original.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd0db48685135a1db7ac.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.12,"goodreads_ratings":107750,"level":3,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29de11b486852b17d9fe9c","5c29de11b486852b17d9fe9d","5c29de11b486852b17d9fe9e","5c29de11b486852b17d9fe9f","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea0","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea1","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea2","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea3","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea4","5c29de11b486852b17d9fea5"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"赫曼赫塞","zh_bookname":"荒原狼"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.12],"goodreads_ratings":[107750],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["荒原狼"],"author":["Herman Hesse"],"zh_author":["赫曼赫塞"],"bookname":["Steppenwolf"]}}

First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land (\"not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made\") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: \"I first heard of ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America,\" and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world. ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, \"had not lost the fire of life,\" lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier. As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that \"ran about like a wild thing,\" the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase \" Optima dies ... prima fugit \" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. \"The best days are the first to flee\"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like My ntonia , was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. --Melanie Rehak From School Library Journal Grade 7 Up--In Jim Burden's accounting of his life with, and without, Antonia Shimerda, listeners are transported to the hardscrabble Nebraska prairie and the rural immigrant experience. When Jim first sees the Shimerda family, immigrants from Bohemia, disembarking from the same train that is taking him West to live with his grandparents, he has no idea the impact they will have on his life. Nostalgically, he remembers the good and bad times they had on their respective farms and creates his portrait of Antonia, an independent and tough survivor. The brief biography of author Willa Cather at the beginning of the CD explains how her life mirrors Antonia's life in many ways, helping listeners understand the context of the story. Patrick Lawlor's rich, fluid voice lends an air of sophistication to Burden, reinforcing the class structure inherent at the beginning of the 20th century. Lawlor's attempts to create voices for the characters often falls flat. Since the novel is Burden's reminiscence, it would have been better told in Burden's voice alone. Since My Antonia continues to be a staple in many English curriculums, this is a good audiobook for schools and public libraries to have available.-- Lynn Evarts, Sauk Prairie High School, Prairie du Sac, WA Copyright '' Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cather s last novel set in the Great Plains tells the story of young Lucy Gayheart, who escapes life in small-town Haverford, Nebraska, in 1902 to pursue a career in music. In Chicago she falls in love with an older singer, Clement Sebastian, who finds renewed inspiration in her. However, tragic chance destroys their ensuing love affair. The novel has evoked divergent responses among critics and readers ever since its publication. This Willa Cather Scholarly Edition includes a historical essay providing fresh insight into the novel, the role of music, and Cather s writing process. It also features photographs, maps, and explanatory notes with a full range of biographical, historical, and cultural information.

Among writers themselves, her name is spoken in hushed tones.' This splendid gift edition is sure to delight Alice Munro's growing body of admirers, what Atwood calls her 'devoted international readership.' Long-time fans of her stories will enjoy meeting old favourites, where their new setting in this book may reveal new sides to what once seemed a familiar story; devoted followers may even dispute the exclusion of a specially-beloved story. Readers lucky enough to have found her recently will be delighted, as one masterpiece succeeds another. The 17 stories are carefully arranged in the order in which she wrote them, which allows us to follow the development of her range. 'A Wilderness Station,' for example, breaks 'short story rules' by taking us right back to the 1830s then jumping forward more than 100 years. 'The Albanian Virgin' destroys the idea that her stories are set in B.C. or in Ontario's 'Alice Munro Country.'

Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly. After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, The House of Mirth, published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. Ethan Frome appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Andr Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London. In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work. The Age of Innocence, a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. - Barnesandnoble.com","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd28b48685135a1e7792.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29df80b486852b17da964b","5c29df80b486852b17da964c","5c29df80b486852b17da964d"],"year":"2000","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"债务"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2000"],"zh_bookname":["债务"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Debt"]}}

Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly. After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, The House of Mirth, published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. Ethan Frome appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Andr Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London. In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work. The Age of Innocence, a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. - Barnesandnoble.com","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dda7b48685135a21ae79.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e572b486852b17dd2473","5c29e572b486852b17dd2474","5c29e572b486852b17dd2475","5c29e572b486852b17dd2476","5c29e572b486852b17dd2477","5c29e572b486852b17dd2478"],"year":"2000","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"传说"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2000"],"zh_bookname":["传说"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Legend"]}}

Edith Wharton ( born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 - August 11, 1937) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, short story writer, and designer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930. Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight. She was well acquainted with many of her era's other literary and public figures, including Theodore Roosevelt. Wharton was born to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander in New York City. She had two brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. The saying \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families. She had a lifelong friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand of Reef Point in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1885, at 23, she married Edward (Teddy) Robbins Wharton, who was 12 years older. From a well-established Philadelphia family, he was a sportsman and gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. From the late 1880s until 1902, he suffered acute depression, and the couple ceased their extensive travel. At that time his depression manifested as a more serious disorder, after which they lived almost exclusively at The Mount, their estate designed by Edith Wharton. In 1908 her husband's mental state was determined to be incurable. She divorced him in 1913. Around the same time, Edith was overcome with the harsh criticisms leveled by the naturalist writers. Later in 1908 she began an affair with Morton Fullerton, a journalist for The Times, in whom she found an intellectual partner. In addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories. She was also a garden designer, interior designer, and taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first published work, The Decoration of Houses of 1897, co-authored by Ogden Codman. Another is the generously illustrated Italian Villas and Their Gardens of 1904.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de0ab48685135a23fd4b.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e98db486852b17deee87"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"旅行[短篇小说]"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["旅行[短篇小说]"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["A Journey [Short stories]"]}}

Lewis, author of \"Edith Wharton, A Biography.\" The widespread resurgence of interest in Edith Wharton's career over the past 20 years has restored to print most of her fiction, travel books, and writings on architecture, gardening, and interior decoration. Yet one significant and substantial portion of her accomplishment has remained largely overlooked: Wharton's numerous exercises in literary criticism. Constituting an unusually little-known body of work by an otherwise pre-eminent American writer, Wharton's many scattered reviews and essays, literary eulogies, and forewords and introductions (to her own work, and to works of others) have never before been collected in a single volume. Covering works of various literary traditions, including eloquent general considerations of fiction and criticism, and embracing novels, volumes of lyric and dramatic verse, and works by other critics of literature, art, and architecture, these critical writings uniquely demonstrate the extraordinary range of Wharton's critical interests and intelligence. A searching and comprehensive introductory essay places her critical prose in the context of Wharton's career as a whole, and draws on a wealth of unpublished materials in exploring the uncertainties and inhibitions against which she had to struggle in order to express herself as a critic at all. Assembling her miscellaneous critical writings (including some newly discovered texts), this authoritative edition makes an exceptional contribution not only to the ongoing\"Wharton revival\" but to the study of American literature, of literary criticism, and of women as writers of criticism.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de58b48685135a25cb20.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":4,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ecdbb486852b17e06021","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06022","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06023","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06024","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06025","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06026","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06027","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06028","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06029","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602a","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602b","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602c","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602d","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602e","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0602f","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06030","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06031","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06032","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06033","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06034","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06035","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06036","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06037","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06038","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06039","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603a","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603b","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603c","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603d","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603e","5c29ecdbb486852b17e0603f","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06040","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06041","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06042","5c29ecdbb486852b17e06043"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"未收集的故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["未收集的故事"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["Uncollected Stories"]}}

In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight. So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives. Udayan charismatic and impulsive finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents.

A great radiance of silver fire, the dawn of a moonlit night, is rising in the east. The stars and the cloudless sky are our own contemporaries, nineteen and a half centuries younger than we know them; but you would not guess that from their appearance. Below them are two notable drawbacks of civilization: a palace, and soldiers. The palace, an old, low, Syrian building of whitened mud, is not so ugly as Buckingham Palace; and the officers in the courtyard are more highly civilized than modern English officers: for example, they do not dig up the corpses of their dead enemies and mutilate them, as we dug up Cromwell and the Mahdi. They are in two groups: one intent on the gambling of their captain Belzanor, a warrior of fifty, who, with his spear on the ground beside his knee, is stooping to throw dice with a sly-looking young Persian recruit; the other gathered about a guardsman who has just finished telling a naughty story (still current in English barracks) at which they are laughing uproariously. They are about a dozen in number, all highly aristocratic young Egyptian guardsmen, handsomely equipped with weapons and armor, very unEnglish in point of not being ashamed of and uncomfortable in their profess-sional dress; on the contrary, rather ostentatiously and arrogantlywarlike, as valuing themselves on their military caste.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd28b48685135a1e7777.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29df7fb486852b17da9632","5c29df7fb486852b17da9633","5c29df7fb486852b17da9634","5c29df7fb486852b17da9635","5c29df7fb486852b17da9636"],"year":"2004","zh_author":"萧伯纳","zh_bookname":"凯撒和克莉奥帕特拉七世"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2004"],"zh_bookname":["凯撒和克莉奥帕特拉七世"],"author":["George Bernard Shaw"],"zh_author":["萧伯纳"],"bookname":["Caesar And Cleopatra"]}}

Unlike his earlier work, from Peter Camenzind through Knulp , the stories in Strange News from Another Star do not allow for an essentially realistic interpretation.

Each traveler finds the rest of the group intolerable and heads off in his own direction, with H.H. bitterly blaming the others for the failure of the journey.

Tarkington is also noted for several charming, idealized novels about childhood and adolescence, such as \"Penrod\" (1914) and \"Seventeen\" (1916), which occur squarely in the middle of the line of literary development that leads from Mark Twain's \"Tom Sawyer\" up to Ray Bradbury's \"Dandelion Wine.\" They are classics of period Americana.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd05b48685135a1d7dd1.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.13,"goodreads_ratings":8,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d2","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d3","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d4","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d5","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d6","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d7","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d8","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5d9","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5da","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5db","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5dc","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5dd","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5de","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5df","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e0","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e1","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e2","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e3","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e4","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e5","5c29dda5b486852b17d9d5e6"],"year":"","zh_author":"布思 塔金顿","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"拉姆齐米尔霍兰"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.13],"goodreads_ratings":[8],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["拉姆齐米尔霍兰"],"author":["Booth Tarkington"],"zh_author":["布思 塔金顿"],"bookname":["Ramsey Milholland"]}}

In 'Fiftieth' old friends reconnect at a class reunion, and one of them is left wondering, 'What does it mean: the enormity of having been children and now being old, living next to death.' In the story 'The Full Glass' the protagonist describes somewhat ruefully the rituals of old age. Before going to bed, he raises his nightly water glass 'drinking a toast to the visible world, his impending disappearance from it be damned.' In 'Varieties of Religious Experiences' a grandfather, visiting his daughter in Brooklyn Heights, watches the tower of the World Trade Centre fall, and his view of a God is forever altered. Again and again in these memorable stories, Updike strikes to the heart, giving words to what is so often left unsaid. He is at once witty, devastatingly observant, touching - and, of course, a consummate storyteller. This is a collection that will be admired and cherished.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd08b48685135a1d948e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6a8","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6a9","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6aa","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6ab","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6ac","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6ad","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6ae","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6af","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6b0","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6b1","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6b2","5c29ddcdb486852b17d9e6b3"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 厄普代克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"我父亲的眼泪和其他故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["我父亲的眼泪和其他故事"],"author":["John Updike"],"zh_author":["约翰 厄普代克"],"bookname":["My Father's Tears and Other Stories"]}}

It's 2020, and war with China has left the United States in a shambles. As cheerfully retired investment counselor Ben Turnbull gets caught up in the \"many-universes\" theory resulting from the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, he finds his identity racing back and forth in time. Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc. From This is Updike's millennium novel. Who better than he--vastly intelligent observer of morals and mores over the past half-century--to wrap up fin de siecle life in one, big, magnificent novel that both concludes and foresees? But what a disappointment! It's set in the future--2020, to be exact. What is the point of setting the story ahead in time while at the same time giving next to no feel that things are different? A war is supposed to have happened between the U.S. and China, but it seems to have had as little effect on daily life as some small skirmish in Somalia. Ben Turnbull narrates a year in his life; he's in his late sixties, a semiretired investor, a lover of science. He and his wife have arguments over a deer who is nibbling her lawn and garden away; Ben has thoughts about science, which he yammers on and on about to the absolute distraction of the follower of this curious narrative. Ben thinks he has shot his wife instead of the deer, and the deer turns into a young woman, with whom he has an affair, but, clank, reality sets in again, and his wife is back. Huh? Even Updike's gorgeous style cannot jump-start this plot; it's gone lame at the starting gate. Still, his legion of fans will want to decide for themselves.

Alexandra, a sculptor, summons thunderstorms; Jane, a cellist, floats on the air; and Sukie, the local gossip columnist, turns milk into cream.

Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that led to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, and he also covered World War II. His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.

Hemingway's men are bullfighters and boxers, hired hands and hard drinkers, gangsters and gunmen. Each of their stories deals with masculine toughness unsoftened by woman's hand. Incisive, hard-edged, pared down to the bare minimum, they are classic Hemingway territory. About the Author Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899 as the son of a doctor and the second of six children. After a stint as an ambulance driver at the Italian front, Hemingway came home to America in 1919, only to return to the battlefield - this time as a reporter on the Greco-Turkish war - in 1922. Resigning from journalism to focus on his writing instead, he moved to Paris where he renewed his earlier friendship with fellow American expatriates such as Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Through the years, Hemingway travelled widely and wrote avidly, becoming an internationally recognized literary master of his craft. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea.

Flying carpets; subterranean amusement parks; a band of teenage girls who meet secretly in the night in order to do \"nothing at all\"; a store with departments of Moorish courtyards, volcanoes, and Aztec temples: these are Millhauser's stock-in-trade as a storyteller, and he employs them to characteristically magical effect. As in Millhauser's other books, including Edwin Mullhouse and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Martin Dressler , his subject is nothing less than the faculty of imagination itself. Here, however, the flights of fancy are unencumbered by Martin Dressler 's wealth of period detail, and the result is fun-house prose whose pleasures and terrors are equally gossamer. Millhauser possesses the unique ability to render the quotidian strange, so that, emerging from his stories, the reader often feels the world itself an unfamiliar place--as do the shoppers at his department store, that marketplace of skillful illusion: \"As we hurry along the sidewalk, we have the absurd sensation that we have entered still another department, composed of ingeniously lifelike streets with artful shadows and reflections--that our destinations lie in a far corner of the same department--that we are condemned to hurry forever through these artificial halls, bright with late afternoon light, in search of the way out.\" From Library Journal Millhauser, winner of the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for Martin Dressler (LJ 4/15/96), shows his boundless imagination in this collection of surreal, fanciful, and dark-edged stories. Breaking the rules of short-story writing, half of the selections lack a central character and are instead narrated by a nameless \"we.\" Though this may distance the reader, it gives insight into group consciousness, something rarely expressed so directly in fiction. We are also treated to Millhauser's elaborate descriptions of awe-inspiring, otherworldly amusement parks, department stores, and underground passageways. Even his more conventional stories give us flying carpets, duels, and two-foot frogs, and for this reason the book is perhaps best read in small doses, lest Millhauser's descriptions become overwhelming.

Erika Kohut is a piano teacher at the prestigious and formal Vienna Conservatory, who still lives with her domineering and possessive mother. Her life appears to be a seamless tissue of boredom, but Erika, a quiet thirty-eight-year-old, secretly visits Turkish peep shows at night to watch live sex shows and sadomasochistic films. Meanwhile, a handsome, self-absorbed, seventeen-year-old student has become enamored with Erika and sets out to seduce her. She resists him at first, but then the dark passions roiling under the piano teacher's subdued exterior explode in a release of sexual perversity, suppressed violence, and human degradation. Celebrated throughout Europe for the intensity and frankness of her writings and awarded the Heinrich B ll Prize for her outstanding contribution to German letters, Elfriede Jelinek is one of the most original and controversial writers in the world today.

They all touch the heart, and what the heart holds to become truth, as far as we know truth.\" The story of a boy, Isaac, who joins a hunting party for several summers, trying to kill Old Ben, an almost immortal and huge bear, a kind of a legend and a symbol of the power and the balance of nature. Seven times Isaac sees it, and once he forgives its life, forming a kind of unspoken tie with each other. Sam Fathers, a Negro who accompanies the party, becomes Isaac' greatest teacher and only friend. The beast is eventually killed in a rather violent scene in which a huge, half-mad dog called Lion is badly hurt, and Boon, a half-mad, obsessed man kills the bear with his own hands. Sam Fathers dies shortly after. When Isaac turns 21 he remembers that scene of some years ago, merging his own reflections on freedom and property; and Sam Fathers, Boon and the bear become living metaphors for slavery, the endless ambition of human beings to submit nature and his own beliefs on liberty and of justice. For me, maybe the most complex of Faulkner's tales so far, but at the same time, an unbelievably beautiful utopia in which it's possible to believe that human beings can coexist in harmony with the natural world, even if our most inner desire is to rule and to finally annihilate it. THE OLD MAN \"its folly and pain, which seems to be its only immortality: All in the world I want is just to surrender\" Old Man is a devastatingly poetic account of a convict who is taken out of jail to help in a huge flooding in Mississippi. After a month and 3 weeks of endless rowing along the overflowing river, the convict will taste freedom again, he will help give birth to a child, he'll save several people and in the end he'll return again to the deputy to be arrested again and charged ten additional years for \"attempted escape\" to his previous sentence. The unfairness of the situation is presented in such an absurd but logical way that I couldn't help but wonder how could it be possible to make some sense out of these unpredictable and rambling waves of words and sentences which stream along with perfect melody, almost like a soft lullaby. Indescribably wonderful, don't ask me why. SPOTTED HORSES My first encounter with the much acclaimed W.Faulkner. I had been expecting something deeply poetic, some eloquent rambling prose full of feeling and hidden meanings. Something dense and intense like Woolf or Kafka. Well, I couldn't find anything of this in Spotted Horses. Set in the middle of nowhere in the Far West, a group of men are gathered to buy horses in some sort of auction. That's it. The atmosphere is rustic and austere and Faulkner doesn't bother to introduce his characters, they seem to appear out from smoke and they leave as silently as they arrived, like some imagined spectres. After this brief experience with Faulkner I feel frustrated because it's like I missed something important in here, I feel like if I was nearly graving it and somehow it finally slipped through my fingers. As I said, frustrated. I'll have to read more to have a proper opinion, but for the moment I can't say I enjoyed my first plunge into Faulkner's world.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd05b48685135a1d7970.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.19,"goodreads_ratings":27,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dda1b486852b17d9d289","5c29dda1b486852b17d9d28a"],"year":"","zh_author":"威廉福克纳","zh_bookname":"斑点马"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.19],"goodreads_ratings":[27],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["斑点马"],"author":["William Faulkner"],"zh_author":["威廉福克纳"],"bookname":["Spotted Horses"]}}

The title story, which functions as her opening salvo, begins with a highly suggestive sentence: \"All over town people are putting on their costumes.\" In some cases, of course, this is a literal description. Tamara, for example, dons a yellow cotton skirt without checking the weather, for \"her clothes are the weather, as powerful in their sunniness as the strong, muzzy early morning light.\" But clearly Shields is also making a statement about identity--about the mix-and-match process of deciding who we are. Thus we get the more discreet high jinks of X, an anonymous middle-aged citizen who, sometimes, in the privacy of his own bedroom, in the embrace of happiness, waltzes about in his wife's lace-trimmed nightgown.... He lifts the blind an inch and sees the sun setting boldly behind his pear tree, its mingled coarseness and refinement giving an air of confusion. The final story, \"Dressing Down,\" details the friction between a hardcore nudist and his reluctant wife, and suggests very nearly the opposite moral: we are defined by the garments we remove. Elsewhere, Shields explores the questions of identity and intimacy with less of a sartorial accent. \"Invention\" features another fractured marriage, this one done in by the wife's invention of a steering-wheel muff (\"Money began to trickle in, then became rivers of money, especially when she introduced her famous faux-leopard muff, which became the signature for all that was chic, young, adventurous, and daring\"). In \"Eros,\" surely among the most elegant stories in this elegant collection, sex is both transcendent and suffocating, an entrance into the self and every human being's cross to bear. Dressing Up for the Carnival is a witty performance in which Shields occasionally thumbs her nose at the very notion of the traditional short story (much as she tinkered with novelistic protocol in The Stone Diaries ). But make no mistake: she's a serious artist, with her eye fixed firmly on the naked (or at least half-undressed) truth. --Bob Brandeis From Publishers Weekly Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Shields infuses this enigmatic and quirky collection of 22 short stories with ingenious characterizations in heartfelt tales that are mostly character sketches capturing the gestural, kinetic truths about the lives glimpsed here, with happy results. The title story begins, \"All over town people are putting on their costumes\" and catalogues a dozen characters finding themselves surprised by the joy they take in their accessories: two young sisters flaunt their plastic ski passes a month after their vacation; a secretary pushes a unique English pram for her boss's new baby; an old man buys daffodils for his unfriendly daughter-in-law. In a similar fly-on-the-wall style, \"Dying for Love\" peeks in on three women who, unlucky in love, are considering suicide, but each finds \"a handrail of hope to hang onto.\" Unforgettable moments include the beginning of \"The Harp,\" when the huge concert instrument falls from an overhead window and injures a passerby; the harpist then visits the victim in the hospital. \"Reportage\" also is memorable for an unlikely happenstance: the discovery of Roman ruins on a Manitoba farm. When tourism supplants wheat farming, it's a boon to everyone except a retired Latin teacher. Many of the stories are light and breezy but not unsatisfying, because the characters are winning even in their mostly cameo-like appearances. Already distinctive, they could evolve into such complex or intriguing Shields characters as The Stone Diaries' Daisy Stone Goodwill or Larry Weller of Larry's Party. Some tales are slighter vignettes, but all share enough whimsy, humor and wisdom to make the collection thoroughly enjoyable and, in many instances, illuminating.

Gimpel and the protagonists of the other stories in this volume all inhabit the distinctive pre World War II ghettos of Poland and, beyond that, the larger world created by Singer's unforgettable prose.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd39b48685135a1ee88d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.17,"goodreads_ratings":1820,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e064b486852b17daf43c","5c29e064b486852b17daf43d","5c29e064b486852b17daf43e","5c29e064b486852b17daf43f","5c29e064b486852b17daf440","5c29e064b486852b17daf441","5c29e064b486852b17daf442","5c29e064b486852b17daf443","5c29e064b486852b17daf444","5c29e064b486852b17daf445","5c29e064b486852b17daf446","5c29e064b486852b17daf447","5c29e064b486852b17daf448","5c29e064b486852b17daf449","5c29e064b486852b17daf44a","5c29e064b486852b17daf44b","5c29e064b486852b17daf44c","5c29e064b486852b17daf44d","5c29e064b486852b17daf44e","5c29e064b486852b17daf44f","5c29e064b486852b17daf450","5c29e064b486852b17daf451","5c29e064b486852b17daf452","5c29e064b486852b17daf453","5c29e064b486852b17daf454","5c29e064b486852b17daf455","5c29e064b486852b17daf456","5c29e064b486852b17daf457","5c29e064b486852b17daf458","5c29e064b486852b17daf459","5c29e064b486852b17daf45a","5c29e064b486852b17daf45b","5c29e064b486852b17daf45c","5c29e064b486852b17daf45d","5c29e064b486852b17daf45e","5c29e064b486852b17daf45f","5c29e064b486852b17daf460","5c29e064b486852b17daf461","5c29e064b486852b17daf462","5c29e064b486852b17daf463","5c29e064b486852b17daf464","5c29e064b486852b17daf465","5c29e064b486852b17daf466","5c29e064b486852b17daf467","5c29e064b486852b17daf468","5c29e064b486852b17daf469","5c29e064b486852b17daf46a","5c29e064b486852b17daf46b","5c29e064b486852b17daf46c","5c29e064b486852b17daf46d","5c29e064b486852b17daf46e","5c29e064b486852b17daf46f","5c29e064b486852b17daf470","5c29e064b486852b17daf471","5c29e064b486852b17daf472","5c29e064b486852b17daf473","5c29e064b486852b17daf474","5c29e064b486852b17daf475","5c29e064b486852b17daf476","5c29e064b486852b17daf477","5c29e064b486852b17daf478","5c29e064b486852b17daf479","5c29e064b486852b17daf47a","5c29e064b486852b17daf47b","5c29e064b486852b17daf47c","5c29e064b486852b17daf47d","5c29e064b486852b17daf47e","5c29e064b486852b17daf47f","5c29e064b486852b17daf480","5c29e064b486852b17daf481","5c29e064b486852b17daf482","5c29e064b486852b17daf483","5c29e064b486852b17daf484","5c29e064b486852b17daf485","5c29e064b486852b17daf486","5c29e064b486852b17daf487","5c29e064b486852b17daf488","5c29e064b486852b17daf489","5c29e064b486852b17daf48a","5c29e064b486852b17daf48b","5c29e064b486852b17daf48c","5c29e064b486852b17daf48d"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"艾萨克巴什维斯歌手","zh_bookname":"傻瓜和其他故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.17],"goodreads_ratings":[1820],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["傻瓜和其他故事"],"author":["Isaac Bashevis Singer"],"zh_author":["艾萨克巴什维斯歌手"],"bookname":["Gimpel the Fool and Other Stories"]}}

The visits constitute a journey to the heart of a country whose history, landscape, people and spirit are evoked by Lessing in a narrative of detailed scenes. Swooping from the verandahs to the grass roots and back again, noting the kinds of changes that can be appreciated only by one who has lived there before, Lessing embraces every facet of life in Zimbabwe from the lost animals of the bush to political corruption, from AIDS to a communal enterprise created by poor rural blacks.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd46b48685135a1f488a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.75,"goodreads_ratings":334,"level":2,"publisher":"HarperCollins","segments":["5c29e113b486852b17db4136","5c29e113b486852b17db4137","5c29e113b486852b17db4138","5c29e113b486852b17db4139","5c29e113b486852b17db413a","5c29e113b486852b17db413b","5c29e113b486852b17db413c","5c29e113b486852b17db413d","5c29e113b486852b17db413e","5c29e113b486852b17db413f","5c29e113b486852b17db4140","5c29e113b486852b17db4141","5c29e113b486852b17db4142","5c29e113b486852b17db4143","5c29e113b486852b17db4144","5c29e113b486852b17db4145","5c29e113b486852b17db4146","5c29e113b486852b17db4147","5c29e113b486852b17db4148","5c29e113b486852b17db4149","5c29e113b486852b17db414a","5c29e113b486852b17db414b","5c29e113b486852b17db414c","5c29e113b486852b17db414d","5c29e113b486852b17db414e","5c29e113b486852b17db414f","5c29e113b486852b17db4150","5c29e113b486852b17db4151","5c29e113b486852b17db4152"],"year":"1992","zh_author":"莱辛","zh_bookname":"非洲笑声"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.75],"goodreads_ratings":[334],"year":["1992"],"zh_bookname":["非洲笑声"],"author":["Doris May Lessing"],"zh_author":["莱辛"],"bookname":["African Laughter"]}}

Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school.

Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul and still lives in the family apartment building where his mother first held him in her arms. His portrait of his city is thus also a self-portrait, refracted by memory and the melancholy--or h z n --that all Istanbullus share: the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire. With cinematic fluidity, Pamuk moves from the lives of his glamorous, unhappy parents to the gorgeous, decrepit mansions overlooking the Bosphorus; from the dawning of his self-consciousness to the writers and painters--both Turkish and foreign--who would shape his consciousness of his city. Like Joyce's Dublin and Borges' Buenos Aires, Pamuk's Istanbul is a triumphant encounter of place and sensibility, beautifully written and immensely moving.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de21b48685135a249491.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.77,"goodreads_ratings":13305,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d21","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d22","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d23","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d24","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d25","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d26","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d27","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d28","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d29","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2a","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2b","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2c","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2d","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2e","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d2f","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d30","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d31","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d32","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d33","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d34","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d35","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d36","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d37","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d38","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d39","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3a","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3b","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3c","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3d","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3e","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d3f","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d40","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d41","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d42","5c29ea6fb486852b17df5d43"],"year":"","zh_author":"奥尔汉帕穆克","zh_bookname":"伊斯坦布尔-记忆与城市"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.77],"goodreads_ratings":[13305],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["伊斯坦布尔-记忆与城市"],"author":["Orhan Pamuk"],"zh_author":["奥尔汉帕穆克"],"bookname":["Istanbul - Memories and the City"]}}

Set in her native Texas and her beloved Mexico, prewar Nazi Germany and the gothic Old South, they are stories of love, outrage, betrayal, and spiritual reckoning that are severe but never cruel, and always exquisitely precise. They number fewer than thirty, but as Robert Penn Warren commented, ?many are unsurpassed in modern fiction,? and when gathered in one volume in 1965 they won their author both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. The Library of America now reprints that landmark volume, The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter , and pairs it with a completely new selection from Porter?s long-out-of-print short prose. Expanding the contents of her 1952 collection The Days Before to include both early journalism and major pieces from her final three decades, the prose works collected here are grouped in four parts: critical essays on writers she loved and learned from, including James, Cather, Lawrence, and Colette; personal essays and speeches on such topics as the craft of writing, her own work, women in myth and in history, and American politics; essays and reports on Mexican life, letters, and revolution; and two previously uncollected forays into autobiography.

But when one day he comes across the birth certificate of an anonymous young woman, he decides that this cannot have been mere chance, he has to discover more about her.

But instead of being plunged into darkness, this man sees everything white, as if he ''were caught in a mist or had fallen into a milky sea.'' A Good Samaritan offers to drive him home (and later steals his car); his wife takes him by taxi to a nearby eye clinic where they are ushered past other patients into the doctor's office. Within a day the man's wife, the taxi driver, the doctor and his patients, and the car thief have all succumbed to blindness. As the epidemic spreads, the government panics and begins quarantining victims in an abandoned mental asylum--guarded by soldiers with orders to shoot anyone who tries to escape. So begins Portuguese author Jos? Saramago's gripping story of humanity under siege, written with a dearth of paragraphs, limited punctuation, and embedded dialogue minus either quotation marks or attribution. At first this may seem challenging, but the style actually contributes to the narrative's building tension, and to the reader's involvement. In this community of blind people there is still one set of functioning eyes: the doctor's wife has affected blindness in order to accompany her husband to the asylum. As the number of victims grows and the asylum becomes overcrowded, systems begin to break down: toilets back up, food deliveries become sporadic; there is no medical treatment for the sick and no proper way to bury the dead. Inevitably, social conventions begin to crumble as well, with one group of blind inmates taking control of the dwindling food supply and using it to exploit the others. Through it all, the doctor's wife does her best to protect her little band of blind charges, eventually leading them out of the hospital and back into the horribly changed landscape of the city. Blindness is in many ways a horrific novel, detailing as it does the total breakdown in society that follows upon this most unnatural disaster. Saramago takes his characters to the very edge of humanity and then pushes them over the precipice. His people learn to live in inexpressible filth, they commit acts of both unspeakable violence and amazing generosity that would have been unimaginable to them before the tragedy. The very structure of society itself alters to suit the circumstances as once-civilized, urban dwellers become ragged nomads traveling by touch from building to building in search of food. The devil is in the details, and Saramago has imagined for us in all its devastation a hell where those who went blind in the streets can never find their homes again, where people are reduced to eating chickens raw and packs of dogs roam the excrement-covered sidewalks scavenging from corpses. And yet in the midst of all this horror Saramago has written passages of unsurpassed beauty. Upon being told she is beautiful by three of her charges, women who have never seen her, ''the doctor's wife is reduced to tears because of a personal pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an adjective, mere grammatical categories, mere labels, just like the two women, the others, indefinite pronouns, they too are crying, they embrace the woman of the whole sentence, three graces beneath the falling rain.'' In this one woman Saramago has created an enduring, fully developed character who serves both as the eyes and ears of the reader and as the conscience of the race. And in Blindness he has written a profound, ultimately transcendent meditation on what it means to be human. --Alix Wilber From Publishers Weekly Brilliant Portuguese fabulist Saramago (The History of the Siege of Lisbon) has never shied away from big game. His previous works have rewritten the history of Portugal, reimagined the life of Christ and remodeled a continent by cleaving the Iberian peninsula from Europe and setting it adrift. Here, Saramago stalks two of our oldest themes in the tale of a plague of blindness that strikes an unnamed European city. At the novel's opening, a driver sits in traffic, waiting for the light to change. By the time it does, his field of vision is white, a ''milky sea.'' One by one, each person the man encounters?the not-so-good Samaritan who drives him home, the man's wife, the ophthalmologist, the patients waiting to see the ophthalmologist?is struck blind. Like any inexplicable contagion, this plague of ''white sickness'' sets off panic. The government interns the blind, as well as those exposed to them, in an abandoned mental hospital guarded by an army with orders to shoot any detainee who tries to escape. Like Camus, to whom he cannot help being compared, Saramago uses the social disintegration of people in extremis as a crucible in which to study the combustion of our vices and virtues. As order at the mental hospital breaks down and the contagion spreads, the depraved overpower the decent. When the hospital is consumed in flames, the fleeing internees find that everyone has gone blind. Sightless people rove in packs, scavenging for food, sleeping wherever they can. Throughout the narrative, one character remains sighted, the ophthalmologist's wife. Claiming to be blind so she may be interned with her husband, she eventually becomes the guide and protector for an improvised family. Indeed, she is the reader's guide and stand-in, the repository of human decency, the hero, if such an elaborate fable can have a hero. Even after so many factual accounts of mass cruelty, this most sophisticated fiction retains its peculiar power to move and persuade. Editor, Drenka Willen. (Sept.)

She never realizes that this might not be true, even when her life falls essentially into ruins. Written by a woman whom I think of as an American post-Civil War Bronte or Austen, Glasgow's writing is strong, and her characters believable. She's actually a contemporary of Wharton (b. 1873, Virginia was published in 1913), and she won a Pulitzer Prize for In This Our Life, published in 1941. If you want to read Glasgow (and you like Austen, et al), you should start with this book and move on to some of her others (Barren Ground, Vein of Iron, etc). As a huge fan of the Austen/Bronte/Wharton-type work, I think Virginia fits well with the genre, but Glasgow's later works remind me more of Wharton's later works (The Reef, Glimpses of the Moon, versus something like House of Mirth)--they explore more of the psychology of the characters and their inner emotions, and the dynamic of relationships, rather than looking at the mechanics of society and the way characters fit within the framework of it.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de05b48685135a23d741.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e93db486852b17dece52","5c29e93db486852b17dece53","5c29e93db486852b17dece54","5c29e93db486852b17dece55","5c29e93db486852b17dece56","5c29e93db486852b17dece57","5c29e93db486852b17dece58","5c29e93db486852b17dece59","5c29e93db486852b17dece5a","5c29e93db486852b17dece5b","5c29e93db486852b17dece5c","5c29e93db486852b17dece5d","5c29e93db486852b17dece5e","5c29e93db486852b17dece5f","5c29e93db486852b17dece60","5c29e93db486852b17dece61","5c29e93db486852b17dece62","5c29e93db486852b17dece63","5c29e93db486852b17dece64","5c29e93db486852b17dece65","5c29e93db486852b17dece66","5c29e93db486852b17dece67","5c29e93db486852b17dece68","5c29e93db486852b17dece69","5c29e93db486852b17dece6a"],"year":"","zh_author":"格拉斯哥","zh_bookname":"弗吉尼亚"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["弗吉尼亚"],"author":["Ellen Glasgow"],"zh_author":["格拉斯哥"],"bookname":["Virginia"]}}

About the Author Rudyard Joseph Kipling was born in the then named Bombay, India on 30th December 1865. Aged six, he was sent to England to be educated, firstly in Southsea, where he was cared for in a foster home, and later at Westward Ho, a United Services College in Devon. A life of misery at the former was described in his story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', whilst Westward Ho was used as a basis for his questioning the public school ethic in 'Stalky and Co'. Kipling returned to India in 1882 to work as an assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore. His reputation as a writer was established with stories of English life in India, published there in 1888/9. 'The Phantom Rickshaw', 'Soldiers Three' and 'Under the Deodars' are amongst these early works. Returning to England in 1889, Kipling settled in London and continued to earn a living as a writer. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, an American. They travelled extensively in the following four years, including a spell living in America, and it was in this time most of his enduring work was written, not least 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Second Jungle Book'. Kipling once again returned to England in 1896 and continued his writing career, although tragedy hit the family when his eldest daughter, Josephine, died in 1899. Nonetheless, in 1901 he completed 'Kim', often considered to be his best work. The following year, having settled in Sussex, he published 'Just So Stories', a book he had planned to write for Josephine. Having refused the position of Poet Laureate, which was offered in 1895, he did accept the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first English author to be so honoured. By 1910, however, Kipling's appeal was waning. His poems and stories were based on values that were perceived as outdated. There was widespread reaction against Victorian imperialism, highlighted by the incompetent management of the Boer War. When World War I came, Kipling had difficulty in adapting to the mood of the public and after his only son, John, was reported missing in action believed killed in 1915, he became very active on the War Graves Commission. After the war he became an increasingly isolated figure, although some of his best writing was to come, with 'Debits and Credits' in 1926 and 'Limits and Renewals' in 1932.

Kipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including The Man Who Would Be King (1888). His poems include Mandalay (1890), Gunga Din (1890), The Gods of the Copybook Headings (1919), The White Man's Burden (1899), and If (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are classics of children's literature; and one critic described his work as exhibiting \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift\". Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.\" In 1907, at the age of 41, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 \"in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author.\" Kipling kept writing until the early 1930s, but at a slower pace and with much less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936, Kipling suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery, but died less than a week later on 18 January 1936 at the age of 70 of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Kipling's death had in fact previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine, to which he wrote, \"I've just read that I am dead. Don't forget to delete me from your list of subscribers.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de39b48685135a24de77.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.83,"goodreads_ratings":53,"level":4,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb0db486852b17df99fd","5c29eb0db486852b17df99fe"],"year":"","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"军营民谣"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.83],"goodreads_ratings":[53],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["军营民谣"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["Barrack-Room Ballads"]}}

Published in 1894 and 1895, the stories crackle with as much life and intensity as ever. Rudyard Kipling pours fuel on childhood fantasies with his tales of Mowgli, lost in the jungles of India as a child and adopted into a family of wolves. Mowgli is brought up on a diet of Jungle Law, loyalty, and fresh meat from the kill. Regular adventures with his friends and enemies among the Jungle-People--cobras, panthers, bears, and tigers--hone this man-cub's strength and cleverness and whet every reader's imagination. Mowgli's story is interspersed with other tales of the jungle, such as \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\" lending depth and diversity to our understanding of Kipling's India. In much the same way Mowgli is carried away by the Bandar-log monkeys, young readers will be caught up by the stories, swinging from page to page, breathless, thrilled, and terrified. (Ages 9 to 12) From School Library Journal Grade 4-8?The law of the jungle?intense competition for one's niche?seems to apply to The Jungle Book, judging from the numerous editions jostling on the bookseller's shelf. The centenary of publication is the justification given for this avatar: but fortunately, it needs no excuse. All the Mowgli stories, and the perennial \"Rikki-tikki-tavi,\" appear to glorious advantage in a handsome format. A manageable size, creamy paper, a clear typeface, and generous margins are as inviting as the 17 masterly full-page watercolors. They are beautifully composed, balanced but not static, freely handled but without any loss of clarity. Mowgli and the animals are characterized rather than idealized. Color and texture are subtle but lush. These contrasts perfectly complement the tension between order and \"the jungle\" evoked in Kipling's text. If survival of the fittest indeed applies to publishing, this edition should have a long life.?Patricia (Dooley) Lothrop Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.","comments":[],"copyright":false,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de4cb48685135a2566e2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5a","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5b","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5c","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5d","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5e","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d5f","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d60","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d61","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d62","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d63","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d64","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d65","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d66","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d67","5c29ec1bb486852b17e00d68"],"year":"1894","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"丛林之书"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1894"],"zh_bookname":["丛林之书"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["the Jungle Book"]}}

Little does he realize how prophetic this motto will be or how damning. For as Philip Roth follows Kepesh from the domesticity of childhood into the vast wilderness of erotic possibility, from a m nage a trois in London to the throes of loneliness in New York, he creates a supremely intelligent, affecting, and often hilarious novel about the dilemma of pleasure: where we seek it; why we flee it; and how we struggle to make a truce between dignity and desire. Philip Roth is a great historian of modern eroticism. . . . [He] speaks of a sexuality that questions itself; it is still hedonism, but it is problematic, wounded, ironic hedonism. His is the uncommon union of confession and irony. Infinitely vulnerable in his sincerity and infinitely elusive in his irony. Milan Kundera A thoughtful . . . elegant novel. . . .

Worry about oblivion, he told himself, when you're seventy-five. Philip Roth's new novel is a fiercely intimate yet universal story of loss, regret, and stoicism. The best-selling author of The Plot Against America now turns his attention from \"one family's harrowing encounter with history\" (New York Times) to one man's lifelong confrontation with mortality. Roth's everyman is a hero whose youthful sense of independence and confidence begins to be challenged when illness commences its attack in middle age. A successful commercial advertising artist, he is the father of two sons who despise him and a daughter who adores him. He is the brother of a good man whose physical well-being comes to arouse his bitter envy. He is the lonely ex-husband of three very different women with whom he has made a mess of marriage. Inevitably, he discovers that he has become what he does not want to be. Roth has been hailed as \"the most compelling of living writers . . . [His] every book is like a dispatch from the deepest recesses of the national mind.\"* In Everyman, Roth once again displays his hallmark incisiveness. From his first glimpse of death on the idyllic beaches of his childhood summers, through his vigorous, seemingly invincible prime, Roth's hero is a man bewildered not only by his own decline but by the unimaginable deaths of his contemporaries and those he has loved. The terrain of this haunting novel is the human body. Its subject is the common experience that terrifies us all.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de00b48685135a23af71.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.56,"goodreads_ratings":13965,"level":2,"publisher":"Houghton Mifflin","segments":["5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f0","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f1","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f2","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f3","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f4","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f5","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f6","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f7","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f8","5c29e8fcb486852b17deb4f9"],"year":"2006","zh_author":"菲利普罗斯","zh_bookname":"普通人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.56],"goodreads_ratings":[13965],"year":["2006"],"zh_bookname":["普通人"],"author":["Philip Roth"],"zh_author":["菲利普罗斯"],"bookname":["Everyman"]}}

His Thalia, Texas, series is among his most famous and Duane is an icon as much as his creator. The Thalia Finale: Readers have followed the life of Duane through The Last Picture Show, Texasville, Duanes Depressed, and When the Light Goes . Rhino Ranch, the final episode in Duanes saga, represents the end of an era and is the most unusual and compelling novel in the series. Irony, romance, and cycle of life: Duane comes back from a near-fatal heart attack to discover that his new neighbor has recently opened a rhino preserve on her property.

The subject of Lonesome Dove , cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

O ver a career that spans fifty years, Larry McMurtry has been celebrated as one of Americas great storytellers ( The Wall Street Journal ) and a writer who stands among our best not only because of his uncanny ability to compress a cogent narrative arc but also because his eye for the moving detail is infallible ( Los Angeles Times ). In The Berrybender Narratives, now published in a single volume for the first time, the author of Lonesome Dove delivers the unforgettable story of an idiosyncratic pioneer family and a truly unique view of the American West, reminding us again that his writing has the power to clutch the heart and also to exhilarate ( The New Yorker ). In 1830, the Berrybender familyBritish, aristocratic, and fiercely out of placeabandons their home in England to embark on a journey through the American West just as the frontier is beginning to open up. Accompanied by a large and varied collection of retainers, Lord and Lady Berrybender intend to travel up the Missouri and settle in Texas, hoping to broaden the perspectives of their children, including Tasmin, a young woman of grit, beauty, and cunning. But when Tasmins fast-developing relationship with Jim Snow, a frontiersman and ferocious Indian fighter, begins to dictate the familys course, they move further into the expansive and hostile wilderness and into the path of Indians, pioneers, mountain men, and explorers. As Lord Berrybenders health falters, and the rest of the family goes to pieces around him, Tasmin finds herself taking command of their collective fate and is finally forced to decide where her future lies. Full of real and fascinating characters, famous shoot-outs, adventure, humor, love, and loss, The Berrybender Narratives is an epic of the American West during its period of transformation, a landscape that nobody understands better than Larry McMurtry. **","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd9eb48685135a216915.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.15,"goodreads_ratings":471,"level":3,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster","segments":["5c29e507b486852b17dcefc1","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc2","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc3","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc4","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc5","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc6","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc7","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc8","5c29e507b486852b17dcefc9","5c29e507b486852b17dcefca","5c29e507b486852b17dcefcb","5c29e507b486852b17dcefcc","5c29e507b486852b17dcefcd","5c29e507b486852b17dcefce","5c29e507b486852b17dcefcf","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd0","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd1","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd2","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd3","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd4","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd5","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd6","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd7","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd8","5c29e507b486852b17dcefd9","5c29e507b486852b17dcefda","5c29e507b486852b17dcefdb","5c29e507b486852b17dcefdc","5c29e507b486852b17dcefdd","5c29e507b486852b17dcefde","5c29e507b486852b17dcefdf","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe0","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe1","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe2","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe3","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe4","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe5","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe6","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe7","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe8","5c29e507b486852b17dcefe9","5c29e507b486852b17dcefea","5c29e507b486852b17dcefeb","5c29e507b486852b17dcefec","5c29e507b486852b17dcefed","5c29e507b486852b17dcefee","5c29e507b486852b17dcefef","5c29e507b486852b17dceff0","5c29e507b486852b17dceff1","5c29e507b486852b17dceff2","5c29e507b486852b17dceff3","5c29e507b486852b17dceff4","5c29e507b486852b17dceff5","5c29e507b486852b17dceff6","5c29e507b486852b17dceff7","5c29e507b486852b17dceff8","5c29e507b486852b17dceff9","5c29e507b486852b17dceffa","5c29e507b486852b17dceffb","5c29e507b486852b17dceffc","5c29e507b486852b17dceffd","5c29e507b486852b17dceffe","5c29e507b486852b17dcefff","5c29e507b486852b17dcf000","5c29e507b486852b17dcf001","5c29e507b486852b17dcf002","5c29e507b486852b17dcf003","5c29e507b486852b17dcf004","5c29e507b486852b17dcf005","5c29e507b486852b17dcf006","5c29e507b486852b17dcf007","5c29e507b486852b17dcf008","5c29e507b486852b17dcf009","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00a","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00b","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00c","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00d","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00e","5c29e507b486852b17dcf00f","5c29e507b486852b17dcf010","5c29e507b486852b17dcf011","5c29e507b486852b17dcf012"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"贝利本德叙事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.15],"goodreads_ratings":[471],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["贝利本德叙事"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["The Berrybender Narratives"]}}

In classic Western style Larry McMurtry illustrates the timeless conflict between the modernity and the Old West through the eyes of Texas cattlemen. Horseman, Pass By tells the story of Homer Bannon, an old-time cattleman who epitomizes the frontier values of honesty and decency, and Hud, his unscrupulous stepson. Caught in the middle is the narrator, Homer's young grandson Lonnie, who is as much drawn to his grandfathers strength of character as he is to Hud's hedonism and materialism. When first published in 1961, Horseman, Pass By caused a sensation in Texas literary circles for its stark, realistic portrayal of the struggles of a changing West in the years following World War II. Never before had a writer managed to encapsulate its environment with such unsentimental realism. Today, memorable characters, powerful themes, and illuminating detail make Horseman, Pass By vintage McMurtry.

This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. --Alix Wilber The Last Picture Show is one of Larry McMurtry's most powerful, memorable novels -- the basis for the enormously popular movie of the same name. Set in a small, dusty, Texas town, The Last Picture Show introduced the characters of Jacy, Duane, and Sonny: teenagers stumbling toward adulthood, discovering the beguiling mysteries of sex and the even more baffling mysteries of love. Populated by a wonderful cast of eccentrics and animated by McMurtry's wry and raucous humor, The Last Picture Show is wild, heartbreaking, and poignant -- a coming-of-age novel that resonates with the magical passion of youth.

Its main character, Hatcher McCord, is an evening news presenter who has found himself in Hell and is struggling to explain his bad fortune. He's not the only one to suffer this fate--in fact, he's surrounded by an outrageous cast of characters, including Humphrey Bogart, William Shakespeare, and almost all of the popes and most of the U.S. presidents. The question may be not who is in Hell but who isn't. McCord is living with Anne Boleyn in the afterlife but their happiness is, of course, constantly derailed by her obsession with Henry VIII (and the removal of her head at rather inopportune moments). Butler's Hell isn't as much a boiling lake of fire--although there is that--as it is a Sisyphean trial tailored to each inhabitant, whether it's the average Joes who die and are reconstituted many times a day to do it all again, or the legendary newspaperman William Randolph Hearst, doomed to obscurity as a blogger mocked by his fellows because he can't figure out Caps Lock. One day McCord meets Dante's Beatrice, who believes there is a way out of Hell, and the next morning, during an exclusive on-camera interview with Satan, McCord realizes that Satan's omniscience, which he has always credited for the perfection of Hell's torments, may be a mirage--and Butler is off on a madcap romp about good, evil, free will, and the possibility of escape. Butler's depiction of Hell is original, intelligent, and fiercely comic, a book Dante might have celebrated.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de4db48685135a25717c.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Grove Press","segments":["5c29ec2eb486852b17e0165e","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0165f","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01660","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01661","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01662","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01663","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01664","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01665","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01666","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01667","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01668","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01669","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166a","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166b","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166c","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166d","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166e","5c29ec2eb486852b17e0166f","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01670","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01671","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01672","5c29ec2eb486852b17e01673"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"特勒","zh_bookname":"赫尔"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["赫尔"],"author":["Robert Olen Butler"],"zh_author":["特勒"],"bookname":["Hell"]}}

Mar?a enchants whether she's dancing in clubs, appearing in advertisements, or walking the sweltering streets of Havana. Her story is one of fierce love, luscious sex, and otherworldly beauty, but also of heartbreak and hardness, as she carries painful memories of the death of her sister and her dear mother. The two main men in her life are Ignacio, a nefarious, strong-willed businessman who provides poor Mar?a with extravagant clothes and an apartment, and Nestor, a poor musician whom she loves passionately. Less prominent but still present is Mar?a's daughter, Teresa, and her growing up in America. Hijuelos's Havana is as much a full-fleshed character as Mar?a as it endures the rise of Castro and the mass exodus of Cubans to Miami in the 1960s. An intelligent and playful ending caps off a vivid story that should delight readers of The Mambo Kings and enthrall those new to Hijuelos's imaginative and florid voice. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd08b48685135a1d9030.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.29,"goodreads_ratings":624,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1a6","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1a7","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1a8","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1a9","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1aa","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ab","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ac","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ad","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ae","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1af","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b0","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b1","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b2","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b3","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b4","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b5","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b6","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b7","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b8","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1b9","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ba","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1bb","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1bc","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1bd","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1be","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1bf","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c0","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c1","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c2","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c3","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c4","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c5","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c6","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c7","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c8","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1c9","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ca","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1cb","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1cc","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1cd","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1ce","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1cf","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1d0","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1d1","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1d2","5c29ddc5b486852b17d9e1d3"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"奥斯卡 希胡罗斯","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"我灵魂的美丽玛丽亚"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.29],"goodreads_ratings":[624],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["我灵魂的美丽玛丽亚"],"author":["Oscar Hijuelos"],"zh_author":["奥斯卡 希胡罗斯"],"bookname":["Beautiful Maria of My Soul"]}}

Readers will be pleased to discover that the star-crossed marriage of lucid prose and expertly deployed postmodern switcheroos that helped shoot Egan to the top of the genre-bending new school is alive in well in this graceful yet wild novel. We begin in contemporaryish New York with kleptomaniac Sasha and her boss, rising music producer Bennie Salazar, before flashing back, with Bennie, to the glory days of Bay Area punk rock, and eventually forward, with Sasha, to a settled life. By then, Egan has accrued tertiary characters, like Scotty Hausmann, Bennie's one-time bandmate who all but dropped out of society, and Alex, who goes on a date with Sasha and later witnesses the future of the music industry. Egan's overarching concerns are about how rebellion ages, influence corrupts, habits turn to addictions, and lifelong friendships fluctuate and turn. Or as one character asks, How did I go from being a rock star to being a fat fuck no one cares about? Egan answers the question elegantly, though not straight on, as this powerful novel chronicles how and why we change, even as the song stays the same. (June) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition. From Bookmarks Magazine Critics loved Egan's newest novel, describing it as \"audacious\" and \"extraordinary\" ( Philadelphia Inquirer ). In the hands of a less-gifted writer, Egans's time-hopping narrative, unorthodox format, and motley cast of characters might have failed spectacularly. But it works here, primarily because each person shines within his or her individual chapter that offers a distinct voice and a fascinating backstory. A few reviewers mentioned the uneven nature of the chapters and the different stylistic experiments within them. Yet, hailed as \"a frequently dazzling piece of layer-cake metafiction\" ( Entertainment Weekly ), A Visit from the Goon Squad is a gutsy novel that succeeds on all levels. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd20b48685135a1e3d68.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Digital, Inc.","segments":["5c29df19b486852b17da6722","5c29df19b486852b17da6723","5c29df19b486852b17da6724","5c29df19b486852b17da6725","5c29df19b486852b17da6726","5c29df19b486852b17da6727","5c29df19b486852b17da6728","5c29df19b486852b17da6729","5c29df19b486852b17da672a","5c29df19b486852b17da672b","5c29df19b486852b17da672c","5c29df19b486852b17da672d","5c29df19b486852b17da672e","5c29df19b486852b17da672f","5c29df19b486852b17da6730","5c29df19b486852b17da6731","5c29df19b486852b17da6732","5c29df19b486852b17da6733","5c29df19b486852b17da6734","5c29df19b486852b17da6735","5c29df19b486852b17da6736","5c29df19b486852b17da6737"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"珍妮弗 伊根","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"围棋队的访问"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["围棋队的访问"],"author":["Jennifer Egan"],"zh_author":["珍妮弗 伊根"],"bookname":["A Visit From the Goon Squad"]}}

It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived. \"Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century,\" said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. \"One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature.\"The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3db48685135a1f066f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e0a3b486852b17db0ee7"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"威廉 史泰隆","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"索菲的选择"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["索菲的选择"],"author":["William Styron"],"zh_author":["威廉 史泰隆"],"bookname":["Sophie's Choice"]}}

Much of his childhood was spent in the comfort of books at boarding schools whilst his actor father was on the road and his Mother contended with her own demons. He spent only a year at University - Princeton - and various reasons have been given for his departure. However whatever his background and education denied or added to his development it is agreed amongst all that he was a playwright of the first rank and possibly America's greatest. His introduction of realism into American drama was instrumental in its development and paved a path for many talents thereafter. Of course his winning of both the Pulitzer Prize (4 times) and the Nobel Prize are indicative of his status.

The story includes historical occurrences at Midway, Yalta, Guadalcanal, and El Alamein as well as the Allied invasions at Normandy and the Philippines. The action moves back and forth between the characters against the backdrop of World War II: Victor (Pug) Henry takes part in various battles while separating from his wife. Pug's older son Warren, a naval aviator, and younger son, Byron, a submarine officer, also participate in combat. Warren is killed at the battle of Midway. Byron's wife Natalie is trapped in Axis territory with her uncle, celebrated author Aaron Jastrow, and another major strand focuses on their story as Jews caught in Europe. Like most Americans, Natalie and Aaron fail to believe that the civilized German culture with which they are familiar could possibly engage in genocide. As a result of their rash decision to stay when they could escape, they gradually get absorbed into the Jewish population that is first interned, then sent to concentration camps. As Byron attempts to find out what is happening to them, eventually tracking them down amidst the chaos of wartime Europe, the story of the Holocaust is gradually revealed to the American government and people.

In the past 50 years philosophers and linguists have devoted enormous intellectual energies to the investigation of how the concept was developed among the thinkers of ancient India, for whom the idea became a central problem in their philosophical tradition. Was language, our faculty for naming objects, given by God or did man invent it, either on his own or with powers borrowed from the divine realm? Through a species of time-space journey akin to Hanuman's, Octavio Paz explores this dilemma: ''What is language made of,'' he asks, ''and most important of all, is it already made, or is it something that is perpetually in the making?'' ( New York Times ) * About the Author: Octavio Paz (1914-1998) was born in Mexico City. He wrote many volumes of poetry, as well as a prolific body of remarkable works of non ction on subjects as varied as poetics, literary and art criticism, politics, culture, and Mexican history. He was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 1977, the Cervantes Prize in 1981, and the Neustadt Prize in 1982. He received the German Peace Prize for his political work, and finally, the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990.

If so, Revolt of the Angels could well be a prime example. In this week's NYRB (Nov. 6 2017), Charles Simic has a piece commemorating Trump's election. In it he puts Trump in a literary context: \"The only character I can think of in the world literature who resembles Donald Trump is P re Ubu in the play Ubu Roi ( Ubu the King ) by Alfred Jarry that famously opened and closed in Paris on December 10, 1896, after starting a riot. A parody of Shakespeare s Macbeth... Ubu is a buffoonish pretender to the throne of Poland, a brutal and greedy megalomaniac who, after killing off the royal family, starts murdering his own population in order to rob them of their money.\" I think Simic is exactly right to place Trump historically in the French Third Republic, and not just because of his Ubu-esque personality. In fin de siecle France Politics are polarised. Religious belief is a defining issue. Racism is on the rise. Freedom, defined to suit, is the rallying cry of both Right and Left. Terrorism is on everyone s mind. Fake news is the only kind there is. The foundations of the democratic state seem less than they have been in decades. The Revolution has been betrayed and the Nation belittled. Revolt of the Angels is a parody of this tumultuous period. But, frightenly I find, it is also a very precise allegory of today's USA - written a century before events. The characters and plot seem out of the Trumpian playbook The Angels in question, mostly guardian and therefore the alter-egos of the individuals they protect, have decided to mount a Miltonian rerun of the abortive insurrection by Lucifer. The Manichaean demiurge against whom they fight is Ialdabaoth (Obama). Heaven is the realm of the Democrats, who have had their unjustifiable way for far too long; earth is the territory of the Republican angelic guardians of freedom and independence from external rule. The ringleaders are Arcade and Istar (respectively Steve Bannon and Vladimir Putin) who plan to destroy the existing order - one merely the republican earthly order, but the other the heavenly democratic order as well, that is, the entire governmental system. These two arrange for the election of the angel Nectaire (Trump himself) as President and Contradictor despite his lack of previous military, governmental or even political experience. Many other supporting characters are identifiable: the female angel Zita (the inimitable Sarah Palin who has already been abed with some of the other guardian angels), the financing angel Sophar (Robert Mercer, Breitbart investor and Trump supporter), the Archangel Michael (Robert Mueller, defender of heavenly interests), the unnamed earth-bound angel still loyal to God (Jeff Flake, of course attacked mercilessly by the rest), Monsieur Sariette (Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who knows where all the bodies are buried; but this could also be Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who fits the description of a wizened gnome more exactly), not forgetting the religious support of the Abb Patouille (a French facsimile of Jerry Falwell). The plan is simple: Our project,\" Istar said, \"is a vast one. It embraces both Heaven and Earth. It is settled in every detail. We shall first bring about a social revolution ... \"' '\" this is facilitated by the lack of discernment among the mass of the human population, \"\"...in a country where the climate is soft and existence made easy? Even here, where necessity calls for intellectual activity, nothing is rarer than a person who thinks.\" Consequently the situation is ripe, \"Beneath an apparently unchangeable exterior all is rotten within. A mere push would suffice to overturn an edifice which has not been touched for millions of centuries. Out-worn administration, out-worn army, out-worn finance, the whole thing is more worm-eaten than either the Russian or Persian autocracy.\" One might surmise that the execution of such a project demands some level of familiarity with military tactics. But one would be wrong because \"The multiplication of technical means, by infinitely multiplying the opportunities for mistake, paralyses the genius of those in command. At a certain stage in the progress of military science, a stage which our models ...are about to reach, the cleverest leader and the most ignorant become equalized by reason of their incapacity....Great numbers, in war as elsewhere, annihilate intelligence and individual superiority in favour of a sort of exceedingly rudimentary collective soul.\" In short, Trump and Kim Jung Un seem well-matched. After all, as everyone knows deep down, \"a war is a matter of business.\" Unlike the first time round, the rebellious angels do succeed in the divine overthrow. Satan becomes God. But (who could have thought anything else) nothing substantive changes in either heaven or earth. Those in charge have those not in charge to worry about, thus the perpetual cycle of cosmic as well as national politics. Now, of course, all this could be merely a product of my inflamed imagination. Trump may well have succeeded in mortally infecting my own discernment through his continual, pervasive rhetoric.

None, perhaps, was less tenable than that which made of this gentleman a personification of the Sun. For this is what a certain school of comparative mythology set itself to do, some forty years ago. It informed the world that the seven wives of Bluebeard were the Dawns, and that his two brothers-in-law were the morning and the evening Twilight, identifying them with the Dioscuri, who delivered Helena when she was rapt away by Theseus. We must remind those readers who may feel tempted to believe this that in 1817 a learned librarian of Agen, Jean-Baptiste Peres, demonstrated, in a highly plausible manner, that Napoleon had never existed, and that the story of this supposed great captain was nothing but a solar myth.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de40b48685135a250bd8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.43,"goodreads_ratings":74,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb68b486852b17dfc1c8","5c29eb68b486852b17dfc1c9","5c29eb68b486852b17dfc1ca","5c29eb68b486852b17dfc1cb","5c29eb68b486852b17dfc1cc"],"year":"","zh_author":"阿纳托尔 法朗士","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"蓝胡子的七个妻子"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.43],"goodreads_ratings":[74],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["蓝胡子的七个妻子"],"author":["Anatole France"],"zh_author":["阿纳托尔 法朗士"],"bookname":["The Seven Wives Of Bluebeard"]}}

Lewis, was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Possibly the greatest satirist of his age, Lewis wrote novels that present a devastating picture of middle-class American life in the 1920s. Although he ridiculed the values, the lifestyles, and even the speech of his characters, there is often affection behind the irony. Lewis began his career as a journalist, editor, and hack writer. He became an important literary figure with the publication of Main Street. His seventh novel, Babbitt, is considered by many critics to be his greatest work. The story follows George Babbitt, a middle-aged realtor who is unimaginative, self-important, and hopelessly middle class. Vaguely dissatisfied with his position, he tries to alter the pattern of his life by flirting with liberalism and by having an affair with an attractive widow, only to find that his dread of ostracism is greater than his desire for escape.

Mencken wrote of him, \" there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\" He has been honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a postage stamp in the Great Americans series.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de0cb48685135a240c05.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e9a8b486852b17def87b","5c29e9a8b486852b17def87c","5c29e9a8b486852b17def87d","5c29e9a8b486852b17def87e","5c29e9a8b486852b17def87f","5c29e9a8b486852b17def880","5c29e9a8b486852b17def881","5c29e9a8b486852b17def882","5c29e9a8b486852b17def883","5c29e9a8b486852b17def884","5c29e9a8b486852b17def885","5c29e9a8b486852b17def886","5c29e9a8b486852b17def887","5c29e9a8b486852b17def888","5c29e9a8b486852b17def889","5c29e9a8b486852b17def88a","5c29e9a8b486852b17def88b","5c29e9a8b486852b17def88c"],"year":"","zh_author":"辛克莱刘易斯","zh_bookname":"我们的鹪鹩科先生"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["我们的鹪鹩科先生"],"author":["Sinclair Lewis"],"zh_author":["辛克莱刘易斯"],"bookname":["Our Mister Wren"]}}

His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been \"old-fashioned\", was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an Al-Azhar sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the Egyptian Museum and the Pyramids.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd32b48685135a1ecaf7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e027b486852b17dadbfb","5c29e027b486852b17dadbfc","5c29e027b486852b17dadbfd","5c29e027b486852b17dadbfe","5c29e027b486852b17dadbff","5c29e027b486852b17dadc00","5c29e027b486852b17dadc01","5c29e027b486852b17dadc02","5c29e027b486852b17dadc03","5c29e027b486852b17dadc04","5c29e027b486852b17dadc05","5c29e027b486852b17dadc06","5c29e027b486852b17dadc07","5c29e027b486852b17dadc08","5c29e027b486852b17dadc09","5c29e027b486852b17dadc0a","5c29e027b486852b17dadc0b","5c29e027b486852b17dadc0c"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"小偷与狗"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["小偷与狗"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["The Thief & the Dogs"]}}

Written with the compression and power of dreams, these poetic vignettes, originally collected in two books, The Dreams and Dreams of Departure , here combined in one volume for the first time. These stories telescope epic tales into tersely haunting miniatures. A man finds his neighborhood has turned into a circus, but his joy turns to anger when he cannot escape it. An obscure writer finally achieves fame-through the epitaph on his grave. A group of friends telling jokes in an alley face the murderous revenge of an ancient Egyptian queen. Figures from Mahfouz's past-women he loved, men who inspired him, even fictional characters from his own novels-float through tales dreamed by a mind too fertile ever to rest, even in sleep.

The ghostly side of Mahfouz s fiction, though less well known than his other works, nonetheless remains a haunting presence. This collection of stories sifted from his later writings brings these restless spirits out of the Mahfouzian shadows together for the first time in English: A murdered man finds himself in the first level of what he mistakes for Paradise - where he faces, along with historical figures such as Akhenaten, Woodrow Wilson, and Gamal Abd al-Nasser, a strange system of earthly probation that may (or may not) get him to the fabled Seventh Heaven. A teenager is warned not to go near the allegedly haunted wood in his neighborhood, only to be drawn into the secret, enchanted life he finds within it. An honest perfume seller is accosted on a night out by angry skeletons, who threaten to march upon his alley as an avenging army if the sinners there do not change their ways. Satan speaks to us directly - to confess that there is still, despite the flood of evil in our times, an honorable man in the land. These and the other startling stories in The Seventh Heaven make a vivid contribution to the translated works of Egypt s - and the Arab world s - greatest modern author.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de5fb48685135a25ea42.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.94,"goodreads_ratings":180,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Digital, Inc.","segments":["5c29ed0bb486852b17e07771","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07772","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07773","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07774","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07775","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07776","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07777","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07778","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07779","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777a","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777b","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777c","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777d","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777e","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0777f","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07780","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07781","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07782","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07783","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07784","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07785","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07786","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07787","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07788","5c29ed0bb486852b17e07789","5c29ed0bb486852b17e0778a"],"year":"1991","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"第七天堂"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.94],"goodreads_ratings":[180],"year":["1991"],"zh_bookname":["第七天堂"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["The Seventh Heaven"]}}

From the Geneva based International Commission of Jurists (who called the executions a criminal act of state murder) to governments around the world (including the United States) who recalled their ambassadors, to the Commonwealth of Former British Colonies, who suspended Nigeria from the group, the response was quick, decisive, and nearly unanimous: Nigeria is an outcast in the global village. The events that led up to Saro-Wiwa's execution mark Nigeria's decline from a post-colonial success story to its current military dictatorship, and few writers have been more outspoken in decrying and lamenting this decline than Nobel Prize laureate and Nigerian exile Wole Soyinka. In The Open Sore of a Continent, Soyinka, whose own Nigerian passport was confiscated by General Abacha in 1994, explores the history and future of Nigeria in a compelling jeremiad that is as intense as it is provocative, learned, and wide-ranging. He deftly explains the shifting dramatis personae of Nigerian history and politics to westerners unfamiliar with the players and the process, tracing the growth of Nigeria as a player in the world economy, through the corrupt regime of Babangida, the civil war occasioned by the secession of Biafra under the leadership of Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, the lameduck reign of Ernest Sonekan, and the coup led by General Sani Abacha, arguing that \"a glance at the mildewed tapestry of the stubbornly unfinished nation edifice is necessary\" to explain where Nigeria can go next. And, in the process of elucidating the Nigerian crisis, Soyinka opens readers to the broader questions of nationhood, identity, and the general state of African culture and politics at the end of the twentieth century. Here are a range of issues that investigate the interaction of peoples who have been shaped by the clash of cultures: nationalism, power, corruption, violence, and the enduring legacy of colonialism. In a world tormented by devastation from Bosnia to Rwanda, how do we define a nation: is it simply a condition of the collective mind, a passive, unquestioned habit of cohabitation? Or is what we think of as a nation a rigorous conclusion that derives from history? Is it geography, or is it a bond that transcends accidents of mountain, river, and valley? How do these varying definitions of nationhood impact the people who live under them? Soyinka concludes with a resounding call for international attention to this question: the global community must address the issue of nationhood to prevent further religious mandates and calls for ethnic purity of the sort that have turned Algeria, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sri Lanka into killing fields. Soyinka brings a lifetime of study and experience to bear on his writing, combining the skills of a poet and playwright with the astute political observations of a seasoned activist. An important and timely volume, The Open Sore of a Continent will be required reading for anyone who cares about Africa, human rights, and the future of the global village.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de52b48685135a259840.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.89,"goodreads_ratings":64,"level":4,"publisher":"Oxford","segments":["5c29ec7bb486852b17e03722","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03723","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03724","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03725","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03726","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03727","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03728","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03729","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372a","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372b","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372c","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372d","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372e","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0372f","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03730","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03731","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03732","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03733","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03734","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03735","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03736","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03737","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03738","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03739","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373a","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373b","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373c","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373d","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373e","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0373f","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03740","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03741","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03742","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03743","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03744","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03745","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03746","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03747","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03748","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03749","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374a","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374b","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374c","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374d","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374e","5c29ec7bb486852b17e0374f","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03750","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03751","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03752","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03753","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03754","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03755","5c29ec7bb486852b17e03756"],"year":"1996","zh_author":"沃尔索尼卡","zh_bookname":"大陆开放疮"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.89],"goodreads_ratings":[64],"year":["1996"],"zh_bookname":["大陆开放疮"],"author":["Wole Soyinka"],"zh_author":["沃尔索尼卡"],"bookname":["Open Sore of a Continent"]}}

He attempts to write characters and families more cosmopolitan European than purely English, but it is more halfway than successful an attempt, and other than a few mixed dialogues - chiefly from the stepfather to the main female the story centres on - it amounts to a caricature of the said stepfather who is only good enough to bluster and really neither commands love nor respect from his stepdaughter or her maternal relatives whose house he lives in, nor at that much from his own daughter who is much younger, except as a matter of duty taken for granted. There is portrayal of beauty of country and nature here too that blooms so very much through his later works, the latter being mostly of English countryside, but here the portrayal falls very short of how very beautiful Alps surroundings generally can be. Galsworthy truly belongs to England and does not quite flourish elsewhere. Here the central theme is young love and art vs money, business vs career of vocation, work vs life assured with inheritance, and again it seems he tried it out first in this and later developed it into various other works. One surprising declaration and admission here is of the fact that it is those that have made money that care for it far more than those who have chosen to work for a living in a career of art due to a spiritual need of working for art. It is but logical that this be so, since one that makes money does not do so by a couldn't-care-less attitude towards money but only with great devotion of time and spirit towards earning and saving it, and while it is a fact perhaps known in life to all, it is but hardly ever admitted so in most works of literature in so matter of fact a way, refreshing in its simplicity. Most different from his other works however - other than the placing out of England - is the little more explicit mention of the happenings of the time. Galsworthy is so given to love and beauty of nature and satirical portraying of upper caste England that one tends to almost forget he lived in an era of tumultuous happenings and thinking, when old traditional castes and their hold was not merely being questioned as in England but was elsewhere being violently rocked and even thrown away, and here one gets a glimpse of a character involved in past in a movement that shapes his life and endangers his love, even though the mention of the movement and its actual facts is left only to be guessed at by the reader familiar with history of the times. All very tangential and elusive, but still, it is there unlike his other works.

My Father Man of Devon:- Love is a much used and little understood reality, with various people experiencing perhaps different things and in attempting to identify the beautiful yet terrifying mystery seek to give it a known name. Not so Pasience, whose name is really Patience but pronounced and spelt in an original way from times before English language got uniform spellings due to print - (although, for that matter, accents and diction and entire dialects differ still across the small nation, and even more so through the rest of the English speaking world, evidence of George Bernard Shaw's witty truth casually given in his Pygmalion as description of US and Britain being two nations separated by a common language - and who encountering a York accent for the first time has not been baffled?) - Pasience who is young, restless, talented at playing violin that she makes sing her heart's music, spirited, and without a woman's guidance or a father's stronger protection or even company of her own age, so that she is eager to experience life beyond what is known to her in her grandfather's company. When she meets men, she has no mysterious veil over her heart, only a yearning for she knows not what, world, life, and she chooses that man amongst all that she sees - she has more than one choice, and young males with varying prospects that are confronted with her are all alike under her spell so she really has her choice of those around - she chooses not the one that is likely to give her all she wishes but one that promises the adventure, lacking the wisdom and guidance to see the difference. A marriage so made in haste can end in any number of good or bad ways, or mediocre as most unfortunate marriages do anyway. Here the tragedy is partly due to times and rest spurred on by the youth of the girl who has only an old grandfather to look after her and to guide and contain her vital spirit. As usual Galsworthy treats readers to beauty of the surrounding country, this time the land and coast and sea at Devon. It must be a hard heart that reads this and won't wish to see it for oneself and experience the beauty so hauntingly portrayed here.

A Knight For My Mother:- One is reminded of the prelude to the film Gone With The Wind as one reads this - not due to any possible similarity, which there is none, but the spirit of the central character (not the protagonist) of this story that is celebrated in that prelude, about gentlemen and code of conduct. A man may be a soldier all his life, and unable to find employment, with starvation to death a real possibility that is avoided only by an ex comrade of a way of yore - and here is a real connection with Gone With The Wind, that particular war in the life of this gentleman from South Carolina happens to be the Civil War in US - and a chance encounter with such a comrade who happens to be English meeting and saving his life in London, and giving him a partnership in a business suited to both, a shop selling equipment related to - and a training school attached to the shop, training people in - fighting. It is love that brings him down, and what is more love for the daughter of his partner, not due to opposition of the father or unwillingness of the young girl, but far more complex. And this is where Galsworthy excels, in bringing our ways of youth, love, passion and complications thereof. The young wife strays to a young stranger who is a student of the school, elopes with him, and the gentleman can only let her be. She comes to grief, the young man having left her and the childbirth taking her life. And the gentleman, having lost his business due to his partner being cheated, and almost all his money too, is now living in penury because he is supporting the young daughter his wife died after giving birth to, struggling to send her half his income every year and living the life of a gentleman the best way possible to him without money. It is the taste and the code that are paramount. And it is the code that he follows to the end of his life.

To My Brother Hubert Galsworthy Salvation of a Forsyte:- Forsytes have been connected to the Villa Rubein story with the business partnership of a Forsyte (James, the father of Soames?) with Nicholas Treffery, in a way the hero of Villa Rubein what with his nightlong ride to rescue the love of life of his niece from her stepfather's threat of setting police on him. Now, the connection is via a passion of Swithin, twin of James Forsyte, for a young Hungarian girl when he himself is not quite young, and having never been social or charming or attractive, is no great catch either. But the girl is young, and generous and sincere as youth will be when encountering someone who is attracted to one, and this is her great fault and reason for downfall. If only she were grown up or knew in some other way that the way to secure respect for herself is to be less generous, less caring of someone else's pain or any feelings, she might have had a different and perhaps safer life. Then again, it might have led to Swithin marrying her and perhaps she escaped the deadly boredom of a Forsyte clan life by being herself, young and sincere and natural as a flower. Swithin cannot help his own passion, and goes after her when her father has taken the family off for a return to his country from Salzburg where they met, but then has a typical Forsyte moment - of an indignation that perhaps her family intends that he marry her, which he finds is quite unnecessary and out of the question, especially since she is not only without a dowry (it goes without mention here but is a silent factor in all dealings of Forsyte with the family) but has also \"yielded to him\". Needless to say he, like most males before and since, does not see that the \"yielding\" on her part implies he was a thief and an attacker that she fell prey to, rather than looking at it as her gift of love to his passion; he assumes - like most males before and since - that it is his birthright to so take advantage of a woman or girl however young and innocent, and that he therefore is free of any need or obligation to marry her. That he thereby forfeits any possibility of a future of a life for himself does not occur to him either then or until perhaps the very moment of his death, perhaps not then, but so it is. He lives - and dies - alone, attended only by his valet, never mind the huge clan and daily visits by his twin brother, and recalls on his deathbed the love he escaped by literally running away from it. He closed all possibilities of opening his heart to love ever after when he did that, and became a fossil of a Forsyte prototype instead of allowing love in his life and blossoming. Thus do one's own choices make for rewards or otherwise of one's own. Monday, November 25, 2013. ....................................................................... To My Sister Mabel Edith Reynolds The Silence:- Galsworthy in this last offering to his family, this time for his sister, tells a tale about a world of mostly male endeavours of yore, although it is difficult to imagine even a century later that it would have changed much in that, and gives a glimpse of a world partly changed in that the colonial era is no more, but largely still the same in that while men do the work of the gritty sort and other men must manage not only the work but the men that do it, their thoughts and feelings taken into account as much as their living and working conditions for the betterment of the place, and yet make a profit for the shareholders of the company, all the while also writing as copiously to the bosses as they might desire to maintain the myth that they too care and have a hand in the day to day welfare and management of the work and the men. It is this last bit, the writing and pretending, that the Cornishman central to the tale cannot abide, and his reluctance to do so that they won't let be, never mind he has turned the mines from desolate vacant bleak place to thriving glamourous place to be and paying a whopping twenty percent for the company at that, and managing all sorts of trouble single handedly on the paltry salary of a manager - paltry compared to the men who pay him and dictate his terms, certainly. When finally forced to do so he obliges with a lengthy missive and snaps. This tale is told sensitively through a childhood friend of the manager who visits him occasionally in course of his own work, and to emphasise the sensitivity of it all, there is the oblique connection to Forsytes - who symbolise the moneymaking trade and industry caste of England and indeed of Europe - with the sensitive Old Jolyon Forsyte on the board of the company, refraining from the badgering of the manager who excels at his work but not at kowtowing to the bosses.

He is viewed as one of the first writers of the Edwardian era; challenging in his works some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceeding literature of Victorian England. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. From the Four Winds was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897, a collection of short stories. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn and it would not be until The Island Pharisees (1904) that he would begin publishing under his own name. His first play, The Silver Box (1906) became a success, and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Along with other writers of the time such as Shaw his plays addressed the class system and social issues, two of the best known being Strife (1909) and The Skin Game (1920).","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de07b48685135a23e55e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.33,"goodreads_ratings":30,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e957b486852b17dedb0f","5c29e957b486852b17dedb10","5c29e957b486852b17dedb11","5c29e957b486852b17dedb12","5c29e957b486852b17dedb13"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 高尔斯华绥","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"皮肤游戏"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.33],"goodreads_ratings":[30],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["皮肤游戏"],"author":["John Galsworthy"],"zh_author":["约翰 高尔斯华绥"],"bookname":["The Skin Game"]}}

The Summary of the drama goes as follows WILDER. [Breaking in fussily.] It's a regular mess. I don't like the position we're in; I don't like it; I've said so for a long time. [Looking at WANKLIN] When Wanklin and I came down here before Christmas it looked as if the men must collapse. You thought so too, Underwood. Written in 1907 and first performed in 1909. About this author John Galsworthy was an English novelist and playwright whose literary career spanned the Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian eras. In addition to his prolific literary status, Galsworthy was also a renowned social activist. He was an outspoken advocate for the women's suffrage movement, prison reform and animal rights. Galsworthy was the president of PEN, an organization that sought to promote international cooperation through literature. John Galsworthy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932 \"for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in The Forsyte Saga.\" Onto a little bit about the drama The drama as stated from the title only consists of 3 acts, so it definitely has to be to-the-point and concise and lengthy and boring. It so does does the trick, not only is it short and concise but also moves at a pace of its own. The whole drama bases itself on the scenario prevalent around a company, named 'Trenartha Tin Plate Works' facing a strike by the workers asking for better wages and conditions of work environment. As can be expected from a company facing a strike it is not just the higher official, a.k.a the board member of the company at a stand-still, i.e., the contracts as well as all the manufacturing and construction are not completed on time but also the worker's family is affected by such a strife. Also accountable in the affected equation are the shareholders who buy stakes at the said companies. The plays centers around the struggles faced by all factions of the societies in such bitter conflicts of interests where both leaders won't budge from their stances (in this case Mr. Anthony, the chairman of the company &amp; Mr. Roberts a very outspoken worker) and the 'trade union' is seen as the peacemakers for both sides. Now a play is written to be performed, and the printed text, like a musical score, is simply the basis for a performance. When reading to himself the reader should hear and see everything, and the practiced, imaginative reader can stage a good performance in his own mind. But drama is a communal art; it is only as a combination of sound, movement and pictorial effect, presented to an audience, that a play can come fully to life. The reactions of the audience are a vital element. If the group wish to please an audience they should not choose Strife for performance unless they can cast it fairly well, and in particular they must have players who can give acceptable renderings of Anthony and Roberts. Keeping all the technicalities of theater aside, Strife is a fast, concise and compact scenario-oriented examination on a particular place and time. Extends its ideological meaning over some part of human pride and power. Stereotypes were many but so one dimensional as to be unpalatable.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de3fb48685135a25034d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.31,"goodreads_ratings":55,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29eb58b486852b17dfbb63","5c29eb58b486852b17dfbb64","5c29eb58b486852b17dfbb65","5c29eb58b486852b17dfbb66","5c29eb58b486852b17dfbb67"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 高尔斯华绥","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"纷争"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.31],"goodreads_ratings":[55],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["纷争"],"author":["John Galsworthy"],"zh_author":["约翰 高尔斯华绥"],"bookname":["Strife"]}}

Growing up in Alaska, young David Winkler is crippled by his dreams. At nine, he dreams a man is decapitated by a passing truck on the path outside his familys home. The next day, unable to prevent it, he witnesses an exact replay of his dream in real life. The premonitions keep coming, unstoppably. He sleepwalks during them, bringing catastrophe into his reach. Then, as unstoppable as a vision, he falls in love, at the supermarket (exactly as he already dreamed) with Sandy. They flee south, landing in Ohio, where their daughter Grace is born.

Fans will be scrambling for The Lay of the Land , a novel that finds Bascombe contending with health, marital, and familial issues wake of the 2000 presidential election. We asked Richard Ford to tell us a little more about what it's like to create (and share so much time with) a character like Frank. Read his short essay below. --Daphne Durham Richard Ford on Frank Bascombe I never think of the characters I write as exactly people , the way some writers say they do, letting their characters ''just take over and write the book;'' or for that matter, in the way I want readers to think of them as people, or even as I think of characters in novels I myself read (and didn't write). In my own books I do all the writing--the characters don't. And for me to think of them as people, instead of as figures made of language, would make my characters less subject to the useful and necessary changes that occur as I grow in my own awareness about them as I make them up. Writing a character for twenty-five years and for three novels, as I have written about Frank Bascombe, has meant that Frank has, of course, become a presence in my life (and a welcome one). When I wrote Independence Day I began with the belief that Frank was pretty much the same character and presence he was in The Sportswriter . But when I went back later and read parts of The Sportswriter , I found that the sentences Frank ''spoke'' and that filled that second book were longer, more complex, and actually contained more nitty experience than the first book. This has also been true of The Lay of the Land : longer sentences, more experience to reconcile and transact, more words required to make lived life seem accessible. You could say that Frank had simply changed as we all do. But practically speaking--as his author--what this makes me think is that I've had to make up Frank up newly each time, and have not exactly ''gone back'' and ''found'' him--although Frank's history from the previous books has certainly needed to be kept in sight and made consistent.

In Petrograd, luxury-store windows are still brightly lit; the Duma debates the monarchy, the course of war, and clashing paths to reform; the workers in the miserable munitions factories veer increasingly toward sedition. At the front all is stalemate except for sudden death's capricious visits, while in the countryside sullen anxiety among hard-pressed farmers is rapidly replacing patriotism. In Zurich, Lenin, with the smallest of all revolutionary groups, plots his sinister logistical miracle. With masterly and moving empathy, through the eyes of both historical and fictional protagonists, Solzhenitsyn unforgettably transports us to that time and place the last of pre-Soviet Russia. Translated by H.T. Willetts.

Although primarily known for his novels, William Faulkner wrote in a variety of formats, including plays, poetry, essays, screenplays, and short stories, many of which are highly acclaimed and anthologized. Like his novels, many of Faulkner s short stories are set in fictional Yoknapatawapha County, a setting inspired by Lafayette County, where Faulkner spent most of his life. His first short story collection, These 13 (1931), includes many of his most frequently anthologized stories, including \"A Rose for Emily\", \"Red Leaves\" and \"That Evening Sun.\" HarperCollins brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.

The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life-her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith-profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of \"historical novels.\" This new translation by Tina Nunnally-the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s-captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition. Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. Kristin Lavransdatter became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world.

An essay. Great one though. Has a ton of great zingers in it against western colonial nations, and also against those in Japan who would imitate the negative features of the west. The first half is where youd get a better picture of Tagore's view of Japan and what a proper sort of nationalism is, and the latter half is where you get the beautiful polemic. \"In political civilization, the state is an abstraction and the relationship of men utilitarian. Because it has no roots in sentiments, it is so dangerously easy to handle. Half a century has been enough for you [the Japanese] to master this machine; and there are men among you, whose fondness for it exceeds their love for the living ideals which were born with the birth of your nation and nursed in your centuries. It is like a child who in the excitement of his play imagines he likes his playthings better than his mother.\" \"You must have detected a strong accent of fear, whenever the West has discussed the possibility of the rise of an Eastern race. The reason of it is this, that the power, by whose help she thrives, is an evil power; so long as it is held on her own side she can be safe, while the rest of the world trembles. The vital ambition of the present civilisation of Europe is to have the exclusive possession of the devil. All her armaments and diplomacy are directed upon this one object. But these costly rituals for invocation of the evil spirit lead through a path of prosperity to the brink of cataclysm. The furies of terror, which the West has let loose upon God's world, come back to threaten herself and goad her into preparations of more and more frightfulness; this gives her no rest and makes her forget all else but [Pg 23] the perils that she causes to others, and incurs herself. To the worship of this devil of politics she sacrifices other countries as victims. She feeds upon their dead flesh and grows fat upon it, so long as the carcasses remain fresh, but they are sure to rot at last, and the dead will take their revenge, by spreading pollution far and wide and poisoning the vitality of the feeder. Japan had all her wealth of humanity, her harmony of heroism and beauty, her depth of self-control and richness of self-expression; yet the Western nations felt no respect for her, till she proved that the bloodhounds of Satan are not only bred in the kennels of Europe, but can also be domesticated in Japan and fed with man's miseries. They admit Japan's equality with themselves, only when they know that Japan also possesses the key to open the floodgate of hell-fire upon the fair earth, whenever she chooses, and can dance, in their own measure, the devil dance of pillage, murder, and ravishment of innocent women, while the world goes to ruin. We know that, in the early stage of man's moral immaturity, [Pg 24] he only feels reverence for the god whose malevolence he dreads. But is this the ideal of man which we can look up to with pride? After centuries of civilisation nations fearing each other like the prowling wild beasts of the night time; shutting their doors of hospitality; combining only for purpose of aggression or defence; hiding in their holes their trade secrets, state secrets, secrets of their armaments; making peace offerings to the barking dogs of each other with the meat which does not belong to them; holding down fallen races struggling to stand upon their feet; counting their safety only upon the feebleness of the rest of humanity; with their right hands dispensing religion to weaker peoples, while robbing them with their left, is there anything in this to make us envious? Are we to bend our knees to the spirit of this civilisation, which is sowing broadcast over all the world seeds of fear, greed, suspicion, unashamed lies of its diplomacy, and unctuous lies of its profession of peace and good-will and universal brotherhood of Man?\" \"The East has instinctively felt, even through her aversion, that she has a great deal to learn from Europe, not merely about the materials of power, but about its inner source, which is of mind and of the moral nature of man. Europe has been teaching us the higher obligations of public good above those of the family and the clan, and the sacredness of law, which makes society independent of individual caprice, secures for it continuity of progress, and guarantees justice to all men of all positions in life. Above all things Europe has held high before our minds the banner of liberty, through centuries of martyrdom and achievement, liberty of conscience, liberty of thought and action, liberty in the ideals of art and literature. And because Europe has won our deep respect, she has become so dangerous for us where she is turbulently weak and false, dangerous like poison when it is served along with our best food.

This rare opportunity took the famous travelers not only to Moscow, Kiev, and Stalingrad but through the countryside of the Ukraine and the Caucasus. First published in 1948, A Russian Journal is the distillation of their journey and remains today a remarkable memoir and unique historical document. What they saw and movingly recorded in words and on film was what Steinbeck called \"the great other side there . . . [the] private life of the Russian people.\" Steinbeck and Capa recorded the grim realities of factory workers, government clerks, and peasants, as they emerged from the rubble of World War II. Like the characters of Steinbeck's fiction, these Russian portraits are endowed with a basic human nobility. Through it all, as the travelers cope with train delays and cramped lodgings, we are given intimate glimpses of the two artists at the height of their powers, answering their need to document human struggle. Wonderfully illustrated with 70 photographs, A Russian Journal is a classic piece of reportage and travel writing. \"Superb . . . forthright, simple and direct.\" -- The New York Times Annotation The document of Steinbeck and Capra's travels through the Soviet Union in 1947. \"As a reporting job the book is superb.\"--New York Times","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1db48685135a1e24e7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.04,"goodreads_ratings":1682,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29dee4b486852b17da51ee","5c29dee4b486852b17da51ef","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f0","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f1","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f2","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f3","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f4","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f5","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f6","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f7","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f8","5c29dee4b486852b17da51f9"],"year":"1948","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"俄罗斯杂志"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.04],"goodreads_ratings":[1682],"year":["1948"],"zh_bookname":["俄罗斯杂志"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["A Russian Journal"]}}

From Library Journal February 27 marks the great Steinbeck's 100th birthday, and the publishing world is celebrating appropriately. The Library of America volume collects the author's little-known 1942 novel The Moon Is Down along with popular standards Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), and East of Eden (1952). If you prefer individual copies, Penguin is also releasing top-quality paperback Centennial Editions of several of Steinbeck's titles, which in addition to those listed above and those in the Library of America collection include his travelog Travels with Charley in Search of America (ISBN 0-14-200070-1) and the Pulitzer Prize winner The Grapes of Wrath (ISBN 0-14-200066-3), perhaps the greatest American novel of the 20th century. Penguin, which publishes Steinbeck's 26 works, reports that the volumes still sell more than one million copies annually. Happy birthday, big guy! Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.

There have been several notable examples of this pen-camera method of narration, but *The Forgotten Village* is unique among them in that the text was written before a single picture was shot. The book and the movie from which it was made have, thus, a continuity and a dramatic growth not to be found in the so-called ''documentary'' films. The camera crew that, headed by Kline and with Steinbeck's script at hand, recorded this narrative of birth and death, of witch doctors and vaccines, of the old Mexico and the new, spent nine months off the trails of Mexico. They traveled thousands of miles to find just the village they needed; they borrowed children from the government school, took men from the fields, their wives from the markets, and old medicine woman from her hut by the side of the trail. The motion picture they made (for release in 1941) is 8000 feet long. From this wealth of pictures 136 photographs were selected for their intrinsic beauty and for the graceful harmony with which they accompany Steinbeck's text. This new script-photograph technique of narration conveys its ideas with unexcelled brilliance and immediacy. In the hands of such master story-tellers as Steinbeck and Kline, it makes the reader catch his breath for the beauty and the truth of the tale.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de17b48685135a2444ce.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.3,"goodreads_ratings":174,"level":2,"publisher":"Penguin Group USA","segments":["5c29e9efb486852b17df1f69","5c29e9efb486852b17df1f6a"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"被遗忘的村庄"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.3],"goodreads_ratings":[174],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["被遗忘的村庄"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["The Forgotten Village"]}}

In hymns to ancestors, passionate polemics, and laments for lost possibilities, Walker addresses the problems of the past while keeping an eye on the possibilities of the future.

She relates his story through the impassioned voice of the daughter of the island's Calvinist minister, a brilliant young woman who aches for the education her father wastes on her dull brother. Bethia Mayfield meets Caleb at twelve, and their mutual affinity for nature and knowledge evolves into a clandestine, lifelong bond. Bethia's father soon realizes Caleb's genius for letters and prepares him for study at Harvard, while Bethia travels to Cambridge under much less auspicious circumstances. This window on early academia fascinates, but the book breathes most thrillingly in the island's salt-stung air, and in the end, its questions of the power and cost of knowledge resound most profoundly not in Harvard's halls, but in the fire of a Wampanoag medicine man. --_Mari Malcolm_ Product Description A richly imagined new novel from the author of the New York Times bestseller, People of the Book . Once again, Geraldine Brooks takes a remarkable shard of history and brings it to vivid life. In 1665, a young man from Martha's Vineyard became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. Upon this slender factual scaffold, Brooks has created a luminous tale of love and faith, magic and adventure. The narrator of Caleb's Crossing is Bethia Mayfield, growing up in the tiny settlement of Great Harbor amid a small band of pioneers and Puritans. Restless and curious, she yearns after an education that is closed to her by her sex. As often as she can, she slips away to explore the island's glistening beaches and observe its native Wampanoag inhabitants. At twelve, she encounters Caleb, the young son of a chieftain, and the two forge a tentative secret friendship that draws each into the alien world of the other. Bethia's minister father tries to convert the Wampanoag, awakening the wrath of the tribe's shaman, against whose magic he must test his own beliefs. One of his projects becomes the education of Caleb, and a year later, Caleb is in Cambridge, studying Latin and Greek among the colonial elite. There, Bethia finds herself reluctantly indentured as a housekeeper and can closely observe Caleb's crossing of cultures. Like Brooks's beloved narrator Anna in Year of Wonders , Bethia proves an emotionally irresistible guide to the wilds of Martha's Vineyard and the intimate spaces of the human heart.

Professor St. Peter was alone in the dismantled house where he had lived ever since his marriage, where he had worked out his career and brought up his two daughters. It was almost as ugly as it is possible for a house to be; square, three stories in height, painted the colour of ashes the front porch just too narrow for comfort, with a slanting floor and sagging steps. As he walked slowly about the empty, echoing rooms on that bright September morning, the Professor regarded thoughtfully the needless inconveniences he had put up with for so long; the stairs that were too steep, the halls that were too cramped, the awkward oak mantles with thick round posts crowned by bumptious wooden balls, over greentiled fire-places. Certain wobbly stair treads, certain creaky boards in the upstairs hall, had made him wince many times a day for twenty-odd years and they still creaked and wobbled. He had a deft hand with tools, he could easily have fixed them, but there were always so many things to fix, and there was not time enough to go round. He went into the kitchen, where he had carpentered under a succession of cooks, went up to the bathroom on the second floor, where there was only a painted tin tub; the taps were so old that no plumber could ever screw them tight enough to stop the drip, the window could only be coaxed up and down by wriggling, and the doors of the linen closet didn't fit. He had sympa-thized with his daughters' dissatisfaction, though he could never quite agree with them that the bath should be the most attractive room in the house. He had spent the happiest years of his youth in a house at Versailles where it distinctly was not, and he had known many charming people who had no bath at all. However, as his wife said: \"If your country has contributed one thing, at least, to civilization, why not have it?\" Many a night, after blowing out his study lamp, he had leaped into that tub, clad in his pyjamas, to give it another coat of some one of the many paints that were advertised to behave like porcelain, and didn't.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd25b48685135a1e6266.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":5,"goodreads_ratings":1,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29df59b486852b17da82b0","5c29df59b486852b17da82b1","5c29df59b486852b17da82b2","5c29df59b486852b17da82b3","5c29df59b486852b17da82b4","5c29df59b486852b17da82b5","5c29df59b486852b17da82b6","5c29df59b486852b17da82b7","5c29df59b486852b17da82b8","5c29df59b486852b17da82b9","5c29df59b486852b17da82ba","5c29df59b486852b17da82bb","5c29df59b486852b17da82bc","5c29df59b486852b17da82bd","5c29df59b486852b17da82be","5c29df59b486852b17da82bf","5c29df59b486852b17da82c0","5c29df59b486852b17da82c1","5c29df59b486852b17da82c2","5c29df59b486852b17da82c3","5c29df59b486852b17da82c4","5c29df59b486852b17da82c5","5c29df59b486852b17da82c6","5c29df59b486852b17da82c7","5c29df59b486852b17da82c8","5c29df59b486852b17da82c9","5c29df59b486852b17da82ca","5c29df59b486852b17da82cb","5c29df59b486852b17da82cc"],"year":"","zh_author":"薇拉凯瑟","zh_bookname":"教授的家"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[5],"goodreads_ratings":[1],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["教授的家"],"author":["Willa Cather"],"zh_author":["薇拉凯瑟"],"bookname":["The Professor's House"]}}

In 1851 Father Jean Marie Latour comes as the Apostolic Vicar to New Mexico. What he finds is a vast territory of red hills and tortuous arroyos, American by law but Mexican and Indian in custom and belief. In the almost forty years that follow, Latour spreads his faith in the only way he knows--gently, although he must contend with an unforgiving landscape, derelict and sometimes openly rebellious priests, and his own loneliness. One of these events Cather gives us an indelible vision of life unfolding in a place where time itself seems suspended.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd77b48685135a20430d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.89,"goodreads_ratings":24870,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e2dbb486852b17dc0ab6"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"薇拉凯瑟","zh_bookname":"大主教之死"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.89],"goodreads_ratings":[24870],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["大主教之死"],"author":["Willa Cather"],"zh_author":["薇拉凯瑟"],"bookname":["Death Comes for the Archbishop"]}}

By using a running English-to-French thesaurus at the bottom of each page, this edition of Song of the Lark by Willa Cather was edited for three audiences. The first includes French-speaking students enrolled in an English Language Program (ELP), an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program, an English as a Second Language Program (ESL), or in a TOEFL or TOEIC preparation program. The second audience includes English-speaking students enrolled in bilingual education programs or French speakers enrolled in English-speaking schools. The third audience consists of students who are actively building their vocabularies in French in order to take foreign service, translation certification, Advanced Placement (AP) or similar examinations. By using the Webster's French Thesaurus Edition when assigned for an English course, the reader can enrich their vocabulary in anticipation of an examination in French or English.TOEFL, TOEIC, AP and Advanced Placement are trademarks of the Educational Testing Service which has neither reviewed nor endorsed this book. All rights reserved.Websters edition of this classic is organized to expose the reader to a maximum number of difficult and potentially ambiguous English words. Rare or idiosyncratic words and expressions are given lower priority compared to difficult, yet commonly used words.

Undine Spragg is an exquisitely beautiful but ferociously acquisitive young woman from the Midwest who comes to New York to seek her fortune. She achieves her social ambitions but only at the highest cost to her family, her admirers, and her several husbands. Wharton lavished on Undine an imaginative energy that suggests she was as fascinated as she was appalled by the alluring monster she had created. It is the complexity of her attitude that makes The Custom of the Country with its rich social and emotional detail and its headlong narrative power one of the most fully realized and resonant of her works.

Edith Wharton ( born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 - August 11, 1937) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, short story writer, and designer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930. Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight. She was well acquainted with many of her era's other literary and public figures, including Theodore Roosevelt. Wharton was born to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander in New York City. She had two brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. The saying \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families. She had a lifelong friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand of Reef Point in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1885, at 23, she married Edward (Teddy) Robbins Wharton, who was 12 years older. From a well-established Philadelphia family, he was a sportsman and gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. From the late 1880s until 1902, he suffered acute depression, and the couple ceased their extensive travel. At that time his depression manifested as a more serious disorder, after which they lived almost exclusively at The Mount, their estate designed by Edith Wharton. In 1908 her husband's mental state was determined to be incurable. She divorced him in 1913. Around the same time, Edith was overcome with the harsh criticisms leveled by the naturalist writers. Later in 1908 she began an affair with Morton Fullerton, a journalist for The Times, in whom she found an intellectual partner. In addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories. She was also a garden designer, interior designer, and taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first published work, The Decoration of Houses of 1897, co-authored by Ogden Codman. Another is the generously illustrated Italian Villas and Their Gardens of 1904.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd9eb48685135a2165c8.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.5,"goodreads_ratings":6,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e501b486852b17dcee42","5c29e501b486852b17dcee43","5c29e501b486852b17dcee44"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"公爵夫人祈祷"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.5],"goodreads_ratings":[6],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["公爵夫人祈祷"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["The Duchess At Prayer"]}}

Take, for example, Shoba and Shukumar, the young couple in \"A Temporary Matter\" whose marriage is crumbling in the wake of a stillborn child. Or Miranda in \"Sexy,\" who is involved in a hopeless affair with a married man. But Mr. Kapasi has problems enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. \"I told you because of your talents,\" she informs him after divulging a startling secret. I'm tired of feeling so terrible all the time. Eight years, Mr. Kapasi, I've been in pain eight years. I was hoping you could help me feel better; say the right thing. Suggest some kind of remedy. Of course, Mr. Kapasi has no cure for what ails Mrs. Das--or himself. Lahiri's subtle, bittersweet ending is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Some of these nine tales are set in India, others in the United States, and most concern characters of Indian heritage. Yet the situations Lahiri's people face, from unhappy marriages to civil war, transcend ethnicity. As the narrator of the last story, \"The Third and Final Continent,\" comments: \"There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept.\" In that single line Jhumpa Lahiri sums up a universal experience, one that applies to all who have grown up, left home, fallen in or out of love, and, above all, experienced what it means to be a foreigner, even within one's own family. --Alix Wilber From Publishers Weekly The rituals of traditional Indian domesticityAcurry-making, hair-vermilioningAboth buttress the characters of Lahiri's elegant first collection and mark the measure of these fragile people's dissolution. Frequently finding themselves in Cambridge, Mass., or similar but unnamed Eastern seaboard university towns, Lahiri's characters suffer on an intimate level the dislocation and disruption brought on by India's tumultuous political history. Displaced to the States by her husband's appointment as a professor of mathematics, Mrs. Sen (in the same-named story) leaves her expensive and extensive collection of saris folded neatly in the drawer. The two things that sustain her, as the little boy she looks after every afternoon notices, are aerograms from homeAwritten by family members who so deeply misunderstand the nature of her life that they envy herAand the fresh fish she buys to remind her of Calcutta. The arranged marriage of \"This Blessed House\" mismatches the conservative, self-conscious Sanjeev with ebullient, dramatic TwinkleAa smoker and drinker who wears leopard-print high heels and takes joy in the plastic Christian paraphernalia she discovers in their new house. In \"A Real Durwan,\" the middle-class occupants of a tenement in post-partition Calcutta tolerate the rantings of the stair-sweeper Boori Ma. Delusions of grandeur and lament for what she's lostA\"such comforts you cannot even dream them\"Agive her an odd, Chekhovian charm but ultimately do not convince her bourgeois audience that she is a desirable fixture in their up-and-coming property. Lahiri's touch in these nine tales is delicate, but her observations remain damningly accurate, and her bittersweet stories are unhampered by nostalgia.

Gertrude and Claudius are seen afresh against a background of fond intentions and family dysfunction, on a stage darkened by the ominous shadow of a sullen, erratic, disaffected prince.

He loses his faith but finds solace at the movies, respite from \"the bleak facts of life, his life, gutted by God's withdrawal.\" His son, Teddy, becomes a mailman who retreats from American exceptionalism, religious and otherwise, into a life of studied ordinariness. Teddy has a daughter, Esther, who becomes a movie star, an object of worship, an All-American goddess. Her neglected son, Clark, is possessed of a native Christian fervor that brings the story full circle: in the late 1980s he joins a Colorado sect called the Temple, a handful of \"God's elect\" hastening the day of reckoning. In following the Wilmots' collective search for transcendence, John Updike pulls one wandering thread from the tapestry of the American Century and writes perhaps the greatest of his later novels.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddf0b48685135a2346db.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.72,"goodreads_ratings":1651,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e822b486852b17de64c1","5c29e822b486852b17de64c2","5c29e822b486852b17de64c3","5c29e822b486852b17de64c4","5c29e822b486852b17de64c5","5c29e822b486852b17de64c6","5c29e822b486852b17de64c7","5c29e822b486852b17de64c8","5c29e822b486852b17de64c9","5c29e822b486852b17de64ca","5c29e822b486852b17de64cb","5c29e822b486852b17de64cc","5c29e822b486852b17de64cd","5c29e822b486852b17de64ce","5c29e822b486852b17de64cf","5c29e822b486852b17de64d0","5c29e822b486852b17de64d1","5c29e822b486852b17de64d2"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"约翰 厄普代克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"百合花的美丽"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.72],"goodreads_ratings":[1651],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["百合花的美丽"],"author":["John Updike"],"zh_author":["约翰 厄普代克"],"bookname":["In the Beauty of the Lilies"]}}

It opens with a self-portrait of the writer in winter, a Prospero who, though he fears his most dazzling performances are behind him, reveals himself in every sentence to be in deep conversation with the sources of his magic. It concludes with a moving meditation on a world without religion, without art, and on the difficulties of faith in a disbelieving age.

From Library Journal A few shards survive in the sandy ruins of Hemingway's garden of Eden: the pastoral and sensual delights of loving and swimming in Provence and Spain; the pleasure the hero, a novelist, feels when he writes \"truly\" about his father and hunting in Africa. The rest is madness, cruelty, and corruption. Unfortunately, neither the joy nor the terror profoundly engages the reader. The bisexual grotesqueries that bind David Bourne, his antic wife, and their complaisant woman lover are for the most part silly or banal, not even sufficiently bizarre to shock.

In fact The Old Man and the Sea revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as Across the River and into the Trees . It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that \"no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards\"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: \"The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.\" Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: \"The old man was dreaming about the lions.\" Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but The Old Man and the Sea was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --James Marcus Review \"'The best story Hemingway has written...No page of this beautiful master-work could have been done better or differently' Sunday Times\" --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd8cb48685135a20db18.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.74,"goodreads_ratings":645377,"level":2,"likeNum":1,"numberOfReading":8,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e401b486852b17dc8703","5c29e401b486852b17dc8704","5c29e401b486852b17dc8705","5c29e401b486852b17dc8706","5c29e401b486852b17dc8707","5c29e401b486852b17dc8708","5c29e401b486852b17dc8709","5c29e401b486852b17dc870a"],"year":"1952","zh_author":"厄内斯特海明威","zh_bookname":"老人与海"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.74],"goodreads_ratings":[645377],"year":["1952"],"zh_bookname":["老人与海"],"author":["Ernest Hemingway"],"zh_author":["厄内斯特海明威"],"bookname":["The Old Man and the Sea"]}}

Hemingway's well-known interest in -- and fascination with -- big-game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative account of his trip. In examining the poetic grace of the chase, and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway also looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. Yet *Green Hills of Africa* is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape, and of the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man. Hemingway's rich description of the beauty and strangeness of the land and his passion for the sport of hunting combine to give *Green Hills of Africa* the freshness and immediacy of a deeply felt personal experience that is the hallmark of the greatest travel writing.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb8b48685135a223203.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e64fb486852b17dd8924","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8925","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8926","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8927","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8928","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8929","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892a","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892b","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892c","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892d","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892e","5c29e64fb486852b17dd892f","5c29e64fb486852b17dd8930"],"year":"1935","zh_author":"厄内斯特海明威","zh_bookname":"非洲青山"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1935"],"zh_bookname":["非洲青山"],"author":["Ernest Hemingway"],"zh_author":["厄内斯特海明威"],"bookname":["Green Hills of Africa"]}}

The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert attached to the International Brigades, lies \"flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\" The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: \"I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.\" For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. \"I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted. If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us. If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go. I am tired of all this. You hear?\" He turned to Robert Jordan. \"What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?\" In one short chapter Hemingway lays out the blueprint for what is to come: Jordan's sense of duty versus Pablo's dangerous self-interest and weariness with the war. Complicating matters even more are two members of the guerrilla leader's small band: his \"woman\" Pilar, and Maria, a young woman whom Pablo rescued from a Republican prison train. Unlike her man, Pilar is still fiercely devoted to the cause and as Pablo's loyalty wanes, she becomes the moral center of the group. Soon Jordan finds himself caught between the two, even as his own resolve is tested by his growing feelings for Maria. For Whom the Bell Tolls combines two of the author's recurring obsessions: war and personal honor. The pivotal battle scene involving El Sordo's last stand is a showcase for Hemingway's narrative powers, but the quieter, ongoing conflict within Robert Jordan as he struggles to fulfill his mission perhaps at the cost of his own life is a testament to his creator's psychological acuity. By turns brutal and compassionate, it is arguably Hemingway's most mature work and one of the best war novels of the 20th century. --Alix Wilber Review \"'The best book Hemingway has written' New York Times\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde8b48685135a230758.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"likeNum":1,"numberOfReading":1,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e7bbb486852b17de3339","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333a","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333b","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333c","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333d","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333e","5c29e7bbb486852b17de333f","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3340","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3341","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3342","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3343","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3344","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3345","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3346","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3347","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3348","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3349","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334a","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334b","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334c","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334d","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334e","5c29e7bbb486852b17de334f","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3350","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3351","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3352","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3353","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3354","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3355","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3356","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3357","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3358","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3359","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335a","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335b","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335c","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335d","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335e","5c29e7bbb486852b17de335f","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3360","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3361","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3362","5c29e7bbb486852b17de3363"],"year":"1940","zh_author":"厄内斯特海明威","zh_bookname":"丧钟为谁而鸣"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1940"],"zh_bookname":["丧钟为谁而鸣"],"author":["Ernest Hemingway"],"zh_author":["厄内斯特海明威"],"bookname":["For Whom the Bell Tolls"]}}

Mystery surrounds David's father, who has re-married and lives elsewhere. David's half-sister (by his mother's first marriage), Janet (23), has returned to the family home leaving behind a boyfriend whom she had planned to marry. The novel covers the course of a couple of weeks shortly after Janet's arrival. It can loosely be categorised as a coming of age novel, but the underlying tone is more stark than the usual fare. Along with the expected events (first time getting drunk and stoned, first kiss with a man) there is a certain poignancy, verging on bleakness. The thrill of discovery underscored by the sad, irretrievable loss of innocence, and the realisation that worse is yet to come. That said, there are impeccable moments of deadpan, brilliant humour to lighten the pathos. Perhaps the novel's greatest strength is how beautifully it captures that all-too brief moment when a young male totters on the border of adolescence. David is simultaneously straddling both sides of this border - he cannot bear to allow his younger sister to beat him in an argument, but is proud when he remembers to keep the thought to himself when in front of company. The author speaks to us from within the 12 year old's head with superb authenticity (\"Before going downstairs he checked his hair in the mirror and tried out different angles of chin, looking for a right way to hold his head\"). His burgeoning sexuality is extremely well depicted: the embarrassing solitary chest hair; his inexplicably changed feelings towards his best friend, Billy; the eroticism of night swimming; wanting to impress Janet's boyfriend Rob; and the encounter with a young man in San Francisco which begins to add some pieces to the jigsaw puzzle of his confusion. David is an incredibly charming, lovable character, with all the quirks of his age (\"Suddenly his walk felt wrong, and he tried to change it....[his new walk] had a certain cowboy quality and struck him as a success\") that it is impossible not to feel connected to him; he will appeal both to you, and to the 12 year old boy inside you. Accordingly, while it is indeed fair to say that there are many coming of age novels around, within this genre, this is one of the best. Track 'Golden States' down; it will undoubtedly become a favourite in your collection.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd43b48685135a1f34b9.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.38,"goodreads_ratings":96,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e3","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e4","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e5","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e6","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e7","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e8","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31e9","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ea","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31eb","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ec","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ed","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ee","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ef","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f0","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f1","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f2","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f3","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f4","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f5","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f6","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f7","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f8","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31f9","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31fa","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31fb","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31fc","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31fd","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31fe","5c29e0e7b486852b17db31ff"],"year":"2014","zh_author":"米迦勒坎宁安","zh_bookname":"黄金州"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.38],"goodreads_ratings":[96],"year":["2014"],"zh_bookname":["黄金州"],"author":["Michael Cunningham"],"zh_author":["米迦勒坎宁安"],"bookname":["Golden States"]}}

In The Hours , Michael Cunningham, widely praised as one of the most gifted writers of his generation, draws inventively on the life and work of Virginia Woolf to tell the story of a group of contemporary characters struggling with the conflicting claims of love and inheritance, hope and despair. The narrative of Woolf's last days before her suicide early in World War II counterpoints the fictional stories of Samuel, a famous poet whose life has been shadowed by his talented and troubled mother, and his lifelong friend Clarissa, who strives to forge a balanced and rewarding life in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family. Passionate, profound, and deeply moving, this is Cunningham's most remarkable achievement to date. Amazon.com Review The Hours is both an homage to Virginia Woolf and very much its own creature. Even as Michael Cunningham brings his literary idol back to life, he intertwines her story with those of two more contemporary women. One gray suburban London morning in 1923, Woolf awakens from a dream that will soon lead to Mrs. Dalloway . In the present, on a beautiful June day in Greenwich Village, 52-year-old Clarissa Vaughan is planning a party for her oldest love, a poet dying of AIDS. And in Los Angeles in 1949, Laura Brown, pregnant and unsettled, does her best to prepare for her husband's birthday, but can't seem to stop reading Woolf. These women's lives are linked both by the 1925 novel and by the few precious moments of possibility each keeps returning to. Clarissa is to eventually realize: There's just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seem, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we've ever imagined.... Still, we cherish the city, the morning; we hope, more than anything, for more. As Cunningham moves between the three women, his transitions are seamless. One early chapter ends with Woolf picking up her pen and composing her first sentence, \"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.\" The next begins with Laura rejoicing over that line and the fictional universe she is about to enter. Clarissa's day, on the other hand, is a mirror of Mrs. Dalloway's--with, however, an appropriate degree of modern beveling as Cunningham updates and elaborates his source of inspiration. Clarissa knows that her desire to give her friend the perfect party may seem trivial to many. Yet it seems better to her than shutting down in the face of disaster and despair. Like its literary inspiration, The Hours is a hymn to consciousness and the beauties and losses it perceives. It is also a reminder that, as Cunningham again and again makes us realize, art belongs to far more than just \"the world of objects.\" --Kerry Fried From Publishers Weekly At first blush, the structural and thematic conceits of this novel--three interwoven novellas in varying degrees connected to Virginia Woolf--seem like the stuff of a graduate student's pipe dream: a great idea in the dorm room that betrays a lack of originality. But as soon as one dips into Cunningham's prologue, in which Woolf's suicide is rendered with a precise yet harrowing matter-of-factness (\"She hurries from the house, wearing a coat too heavy for the weather. It is 1941. She has left a note for Leonard, and another for Vanessa.\"), the reader becomes completely entranced. This book more than fulfills the promise of Cunningham's 1990 debut, A Home at the End of the World, while showing that sweep does not necessarily require the sprawl of his second book, Flesh and Blood. In alternating chapters, the three stories unfold: \"Mrs. Woolf,\" about Virginia's own struggle to find an opening for Mrs. Dalloway in 1923; \"Mrs. Brown,\" about one Laura Brown's efforts to escape, somehow, an airless marriage in California in 1949 while, coincidentally, reading Mrs. Dalloway; and \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" which is set in 1990s Greenwich Village and concerns Clarissa Vaughan's preparations for a party for her gay--and dying--friend, Richard, who has nicknamed her Mrs. Dalloway. Cunningham's insightful use of the historical record concerning Woolf in her household outside London in the 1920s is matched by his audacious imagining of her inner lifeand his equally impressive plunges into the lives of Laura and Clarissa. The book would have been altogether absorbing had it been linked only thematically. However, Cunningham cleverly manages to pull the stories even more intimately togther in the closing pages. Along the way, rich and beautifully nuanced scenes follow one upon the other: Virginia, tired and weak, irked by the early arrival of headstrong sister Vanessa, her three children and the dead bird they bury in the backyard; Laura's afternoon escape to an L.A. hotel to read for a few hours; Clarissa's anguished witnessing of her friend's suicidal jump down an airshaft, rendered with unforgettable detail. The overall effect of this book is twofold. First, it makes a reader hunger to know all about Woolf, again; readers may be spooked at times, as Woolf's spirit emerges in unexpected ways, but hers is an abiding presence, more about living than dying. Second, and this is the gargantuan accomplishment of this small book, it makes a reader believe in the possibility and depth of a communality based on great literature, literature that has shown people how to live and what to ask of life. (Nov.) FYI: The Hours was a working title that Woolf for a time gave to Mrs. Dalloway.

With a spacious loft, a college-age daughter in Boston, and lively friends, they are admirable, enviable contemporary urbanites with every reason, it seems, to be happy. Then Rebeccas much younger look-alike brother, Ethan (known in thefamily as Mizzy, the mistake), shows up for a visit. A beautiful, beguiling twenty-three-year-old with a history of drug problems, Mizzy is wayward, at loose ends, looking for direction. And in his presence, Peter finds himself questioning his artists, their work, his careerthe entire world he has so carefully constructed.Like his legendary, Pulitzer Prizewinning novel, The Hours, Michael Cunninghams masterly new novel is a heartbreaking look at the way we live now.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously. Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, The Marble Faun , at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, Soldier s Pay , was published in 1926, followed a year later by Mosquitoes , a literary satire. His next book, Flags in the Dust , was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher s insistence and appeared finally as Sartoris in 1929. In the meantime he had completed The Sound and the Fury , and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished Sanctuary and was ready to begin writing As I Lay Dying . That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier. Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels Light in August (1932), Pylon (1935), Absalom, Absalom! (1936), The Unvanquished (1938), The Wild Palms (1939), The Hamlet (1940), and Go Down, Moses (1942) and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on To Have and Have Not , The Big Sleep , and Land of the Pharaohs , among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology The Portable Faulkner brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature. Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in The Sound and the Fury . No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner s imagination, Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley s anthology. The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations. In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books Intruder in the Dust (1948), Requiem for a Nun (1951), A Fable (1954), The Town (1957), The Mansion (1959), and The Reivers (1962) he continued to explore what he had called the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself, but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962. Excerpt. Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Mink 1 The jury said \"Guilty\" and the Judge said \"Life\" but he didn't hear them. He wasn't listening. In fact, he hadn't been able to listen since that first day when the Judge banged his little wooden hammer on the high desk until he, Mink, dragged his gaze back from the far door of the courtroom to see what in the world the man wanted, and he, the Judge, leaned down across the desk hollering: \"You, Snopes! Did you or didn't you kill Zack Houston?\" and he, Mink, said, \"Dont bother me now. Cant you see I'm busy?\" then turned his own head to look again toward the distant door at the back of the room, himself hollering into, against, across the wall of little wan faces hemming him in: \"Snopes! Flem Snopes! Anybody here that'll go and bring Flem Snopes! I'll pay you-Flem'll pay you!\" Because he hadn't had time to listen. In fact, that whole first trip, handcuffed to the deputy, from his jail cell to the courtroom, had been a senseless, a really outrageously foolish interference with and interruption, and each subsequent daily manacled trip and transference, of the solution to both their problems-his and the damned law's both-if they had only waited and let him alone: the watching, his dirty hands gripping among the grimed interstices of the barred window above the street, which had been his one, his imperious need during the entire two months between his incarceration and the opening of the Court. At first, during the first few days behind the barred window, he had simply been impatient with his own impatience and-yes, he admitted it- his own stupidity. Long before the moment came when he had had to aim the gun and fire the shot, he knew that his cousin Flem, the only member of his clan with the power to and the reason to, or at least to be expected to, extricate him from its consequences, would not be there to do it. He even knew why Flem would not be there for at least a year; Frenchman's Bend was too small: everybody in it knew everything about everybody else; they would all have seen through that Texas trip even without the hurrah and hullabaloo that Varner girl had been causing ever since she (or whoever else it was) found the first hair on her bump, not to mention just this last past spring and summer while that durn McCarron boy was snuffing and fighting everybody else off exactly like a gang of rutting dogs. So that long before Flem married her, he, Mink, and everybody else in ten miles of the Bend knew that old Will Varner was going to have to marry her off to somebody, and that quick, if he didn't want a woods- colt in his back yard next grass. And when it was Flem that finally married her, he, Mink, anyway was not surprised. It was Flem, with his usual luck. All right, more than just luck then: the only man in Frenchman's Bend that ever stood up to and held his own with old Will Varner; that had done already more or less eliminated Jody, old Will's only son, out of the store, and now was fixing to get hold of half of all the rest of it by being old Will's only son-in-law. That just by marrying her in time to save her from dropping a bastard, Flem would not only be the rightful husband of that damn girl that had kept every man under eighty years old in Frenchman's Bend in an uproar ever since she was fifteen years old by just watching her walk past, but he had got paid for it to boot: not only the right to fumble his hand every time the notion struck him under that dress that rutted a man just thinking even about somebody else's hand doing it, but was getting a free deed to that whole Old Frenchman place for doing it. So he knew Flem would not be there when he would need him, since he knew that Flem and his new wife would have to stay away from Frenchman's Bend at least long enough for what they would bring back with them to be able to call itself only twelve months old without everybody that looked at it dying of laughing. Only, when the moment finally came, when the instant finally happened when he could no longer defer having to aim the gun and pull the trigger, he had forgot that. No, that was a lie. He hadn't forgot it. He simply could wait no longer: Houston himself would not let him wait longer-and that too was one more injury which Zack Houston in the very act of dying, had done him: compelled him, Mink, to kill him at a time when the only person who had the power to save him and would have had to save him whether he wanted to or not because of the ancient immutable laws of simple blood kinship, was a thousand miles away; and this time it was an irreparable injury because in the very act of committing it, Houston had escaped forever all retribution for it. He had not forgotten that his cousin would not be there. He simply couldn't wait any longer. He had simply had to trust them-the Them of whom it was promised that not even a sparrow should fall unmarked. By them he didn't mean that whatever-it-was that folks referred to as Old Moster. He didn't believe in any Old Moster. He had seen too much in his time that, if any Old Moster existed, with eyes as sharp and power as strong as was claimed He had, He would have done something about. Besides, he, Mink, wasn't religious. He hadn't been to a church since he was fifteen years old and never aimed to go again-places which a man with a hole in his gut and a rut in his britches that he couldn't satisfy at home, used, by calling himself a preacher of God, to get conveniently together the biggest possible number of women that he could tempt with the reward of the one in return for the job of the other-the job of filling his hole in payment for getting theirs plugged the first time the husband went to the field and she could slip off to the bushes where the preacher was waiting; the wives coming because here was the best market they knowed of to swap a mess of fried chicken or a sweet potato pie; the husbands coming not to interrupt the trading because he knowed he couldn't interrupt it or even keep up with it, but at least to try and find out if his wife's name would come to the head of the waiting list today or if maybe he could still finish scratching that last forty before he would have to tie her to the bedpost and hide behind the door watching; and the young folks not even bothering to enter the church a-tall for already running to be the first couple behind the nearest handy thicket-bush. He meant, simply, that them-they-it, whichever and whatever you wanted to call it, who represented a simple fundamental justice and equity in human affairs, or else a man might just as well quit; the they, them, it, call them what you like, which simply would not, could not harass and harry a man forever without someday, at some moment, letting him get his own just and equal licks back in return. They could harass and worry him, or They could even just sit back and watch everything go against him right along without missing a lick, almost like there was a pattern to it; just sit back and watch and-all right, why not? he-a man-didn't mind, as long as he was a man and there was a justice to it- enjoy it too; maybe in fact They were even testing him, to see if he was a man or not, man enough to take a little harassment and worry and so deserve his own licks back when his turn came. But at least that moment would come when it was his turn, when he had earned the right to have his own just and equal licks back, just as They had earned the right to test him and even to enjoy the testing; the moment when They would have to prove to him that They were as much a man as he had proved to Them that he was; when he not only would have to depend on Them but had won the right to depend on Them and find Them faithful; and They dared not, They would not dare, to let him down, else it would be as hard for Them to live with themselves afterward as it had finally become for him to live with himself and still keep on taking what he had taken from Zack Houston. So he knew that morning that Flem was not going to be there. It was simply that he could wait no longer; the moment had simply come when he and Zack Houston could, must, no longer breathe the same air. And so, lacking his cousin's presence, he must fall back on that right to depend on them which he had earned by never before in his life demanding anything of them. It began in the spring. No, it began in the fall before. No, it began a long time before that even. It began at the very instant Houston was born already shaped for arrogance and intolerance and pride. Not at the moment when the two of them, he, Mink Snopes also, began to breathe the same north Mississippi air, because he, Mink, was not a contentious man. He had never been. It was simply that his own bad luck had all his life continually harassed and harried him into the constant and unflagging necessity of defending his own simple rights. Though it was not until the summer before that first fall that Houston's destiny had actually and finally impinged on his, Mink's, own fate-which was another facet of the outrage: that nothing, not even they, least of all they, had vouchsafed him any warning of what that first encounter would end in. This was the year after Houston's young wife had gone into the stallion's stall hunting a hen-nest and the horse had killed her and any decent man would have thought that any decent husband would have destroyed the horse as fast as he could have run to the house and got his pistol. But not Houston. Houston was not only rich enough to own a blooded stallion capable of killing his wife, but arrogant and intolerant enough to defy all decency afterward and keep the horse: supposed to be so grieving over his wife that even the neighbors didn't dare knock on his front door anymore, yet two or three times a week ripping up and down the road on that next murderer of a horse, with that big Bluetick hound running like a greyhound or another horse along beside it, right up to Varner's store and not even getting down: the three of them just waiting there in the road-the arrogant intolerant man and the bad-eyed horse and the dog that bared its teeth and raised its hackles any time anybody went near it-while H...","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dddfb48685135a22badf.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.13,"goodreads_ratings":1011,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e732b486852b17ddf8df","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e0","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e1","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e2","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e3","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e4","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e5","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e6","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e7","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e8","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8e9","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8ea","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8eb","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8ec","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8ed","5c29e732b486852b17ddf8ee"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"威廉福克纳","zh_bookname":"豪宅"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.13],"goodreads_ratings":[1011],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["豪宅"],"author":["William Faulkner"],"zh_author":["威廉福克纳"],"bookname":["The Mansion"]}}

About the Author PATRICK WHITE (1912 1990) was born in London and traveled to Sydney with his Australian parents six months later. White was a solitary, precocious, asthmatic child and at thirteen was sent to an English boarding school, a miserable experience. At eighteen he returned to Australia and worked as a jackaroo on an isolated sheep station. Two years later, he went up to Cambridge, settling afterwards in London, where he published his first two books. White joined the RAF in 1940 and served as an intelligence officer in the Middle East. At war s end, he and his partner, Manoly Lascaris, bought an old house in a Sydney suburb, where they lived with their four Schnauzers. For the next eighteen years, the two men farmed their six acres while White worked on some of his finest novels, including The Tree of Man (1955), Voss (1957), and Riders in the Chariot (1961). When he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973, he did not attend the ceremony but, with his takings and some of his own money, created an award to help older writers who hadn t received their due: the first recipient was Christina Stead. Late in life, when asked for a list of his loves, White responded: \"Silence, the company of friends, unexpected honesty, reading, going to the pictures, dreams, uncluttered landscapes, city streets, faces, good food, cooking small meals, whisky, sex, pugs, the thought of an Australian republic, my ashes floating off at last.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de22b48685135a24a0b9.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.97,"goodreads_ratings":622,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ea85b486852b17df6614","5c29ea85b486852b17df6615","5c29ea85b486852b17df6616","5c29ea85b486852b17df6617","5c29ea85b486852b17df6618","5c29ea85b486852b17df6619","5c29ea85b486852b17df661a"],"year":"2002","zh_author":"帕特里克白","zh_bookname":"战车中的骑手"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.97],"goodreads_ratings":[622],"year":["2002"],"zh_bookname":["战车中的骑手"],"author":["Patrick White"],"zh_author":["帕特里克白"],"bookname":["Riders in the Chariot"]}}

The majority of her novels have Southern settings, reflecting her awareness of the enormous social and economic changes occuring in the South both in the decades before her birth and throughout her own life. Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow (1873-1945) was a Pulitzer Prize winning American novelist from Richmond, Virginia. Beginning in 1897, she wrote 20 novels and many short stories, mainly about life in Virginia. Her own education had been rudimentary, a fact Glasgow compensated for by reading widely. She maintained a close lifelong friendship with James Branch Cabell, another notable Richmond writer. She spent many summers at her family's Bumpass, Virginia estate, the historic Jerdone Castle plantation, a venue that reappears in her writings. Her works include: The Descendant (1897), Phases of an Inferior Planet (1898), The Voice of the People (1900), The Battle- Ground (1902), The Deliverance; A Romance of the Virginia Tobacco Fields (1904), The Romance of a Plain Man (1909), Virginia (1913), The Builders (1919), The Past (1920), Barren Ground (1925), The Romantic Comedians (1926), They Stooped to Folly (1929), The Sheltered Life (1932), Vein of Iron (1935), In This Our Life (1941).","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd96b48685135a212dd4.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e491b486852b17dcc264","5c29e491b486852b17dcc265"],"year":"","zh_author":"格拉斯哥","zh_bookname":"过去"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["过去"],"author":["Ellen Glasgow"],"zh_author":["格拉斯哥"],"bookname":["The Past"]}}

They are sometimes thinly veiled tales of the gospel according to the author, taking on the claustrophobic air of a personal fantasia that can't be shared. Such is not the case with Philip Roth's tour de force, The Plot Against America . It is a credible, fully-realized picture of what could happen anywhere, at any time, if the right people and circumstances come together. The Plot Against America explores a wholly imagined thesis and sees it through to the end: Charles A. Lindbergh defeats FDR for the Presidency in 1940. Lindbergh, the \"Lone Eagle,\" captured the country's imagination by his solo Atlantic crossing in 1927 in the monoplane, Spirit of St. Louis , then had the country's sympathy upon the kidnapping and murder of his young son. He was a true American hero: brave, modest, handsome, a patriot. According to some reliable sources, he was also a rabid isolationist, Nazi sympathizer, and a crypto-fascist. It is these latter attributes of Lindbergh that inform the novel. The story is framed in Roth's own family history: the family flat in Weequahic, the neighbors, his parents, Bess and Herman, his brother, Sandy and seven-year-old Philip. Jewishness is always the scrim through which Roth examines American contemporary culture. His detractors say that he sees persecution everywhere, that he is vigilant in \"Keeping faith with the certainty of Jewish travail\"; his less severe critics might cavil about his portrayal of Jewish mothers and his sexual obsession, but generally give him good marks, and his fans read every word he writes and heap honors upon him. This novel will engage and satisfy every camp. \"Fear presides over these memories, a perpetual fear. Of course, no childhood is without its terrors, yet I wonder if I would have been a less frightened boy if Lindbergh hadn't been president or if I hadn't been the offspring of Jews.\" This is the opening paragraph of the book, which sets the stage and tone for all that follows. Fear is palpable throughout; fear of things both real and imagined. A central event of the novel is the relocation effort made through the Office of American Absorption, a government program whereby Jews would be placed, family by family, across the nation, thereby breaking up their neighborhoods--ghettos--and removing them from each other and from any kind of ethnic solidarity. The impact this edict has on Philip and all around him is horrific and life-changing. Throughout the novel, Roth interweaves historical names such as Walter Winchell, who tries to run against Lindbergh. The twist at the end is more than surprising--it is positively ingenious. Roth has written a magnificent novel, arguably his best work in a long time. It is tempting to equate his scenario with current events, but resist, resist. Of course it is a cautionary tale, but, beyond that, it is a contribution to American letters by a man working at the top of his powers. --Valerie Ryan From Publishers Weekly During his long career, Roth has shown himself a master at creating fictional doppelg ngers. In this stunning novel, he creates a mesmerizing alternate world as well, in which Charles A. Lindbergh defeats FDR in the 1940 presidential election, and Philip, his parents and his brother weather the storm in Newark, N.J. Incorporating Lindbergh's actual radio address in which he accused the British and the Jews of trying to force America into a foreign war, Roth builds an eerily logical narrative that shows how isolationists in and out of government, emboldened by Lindbergh's blatant anti-Semitism (he invites von Ribbentrop to the White House, etc.), enact new laws and create an atmosphere of religious hatred that culminates in nationwide pogroms.Historical figures such as Walter Winchell, Fiorello La Guardia and Henry Ford inhabit this chillingly plausible fiction, which is as suspenseful as the best thrillers and illustrates how easily people can be persuaded by self-interest to abandon morality. The novel is, in addition, a moving family drama, in which Philip's fiercely ethical father, Herman, finds himself unable to protect his loved ones, and a family schism develops between those who understand the eventual outcome of Lindbergh's policies and those who are co-opted into abetting their own potential destruction. Many episodes are touching and hilarious: young Philip experiences the usual fears and misapprehensions of a pre-adolescent; locks himself into a neighbor's bathroom; gets into dangerous mischief with a friend; watches his cousin masturbating with no comprehension of the act. In the balance of personal, domestic and national events, the novel is one of Roth's most deft creations, and if the lollapalooza of an ending is bizarre with its revisionist theory about the motives behind Lindbergh's anti-Semitism, it's the subtext about what can happen when government limits religious liberties in the name of the national interest that gives the novel moral authority. Roth's writing has never been so direct and accessible while retaining its stylistic precision and acute insights into human foibles and follies.

Ames is the son of an Iowan preacher and the grandson of a minister who, as a young man in Maine, saw a vision of Christ bound in chains and came west to Kansas to fight for abolition: He \"preached men into the Civil War,\" then, at age fifty, became a chaplain in the Union Army, losing his right eye in battle. Reverend Ames writes to his son about the tension between his fatheran ardent pacifistand his grandfather, whose pistol and bloody shirts, concealed in an army blanket, may be relics from the fight between the abolitionists and those settlers who wanted to vote Kansas into the union as a slave state. And he tells a story of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, which are tested in his tender and strained relationship with his namesake, John Ames Boughton, his best friend's wayward son. This is also the tale of another remarkable visionnot a corporeal vision of God but the vision of life as a wondrously strange creation. It tells how wisdom was forged in Ames's soul during his solitary life, and how history lives through generations, pervasively present even when betrayed and forgotten. Gilead is the long-hoped-for second novel by one of our finest writers, a hymn of praise and lamentation to the God-haunted existence that Reverend Ames loves passionately, and from which he will soon part.

Set in the 1960s against the backdrop of the honky-tonk glamour of the rodeo and the desperation of suburban Houston, it is the story of the restless and lovable Patsy Carpenter, one of Larry McMurtry's most unforgettable characters. Patsy -- young, beautiful, with a sharp tongue and an irresistible charm -- and her shiftless husband, Jim, are adrift in the West. Patsy moves through affairs of the heart like small towns -- there's Pete, the rodeo clown, and Hank, the graduate student, and others -- always in search of the life that seems ever receding around the next bend. Peopled with a riotously colorful cast of highbrows, cowpokes, and rodeo queens, in its wry humor, tenderness, and epic panorama, Moving On is a celebration of our land by one of America's best-loved authors. Moving On is vintage McMurtry.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de40b48685135a250b6b.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.82,"goodreads_ratings":1143,"level":2,"publisher":"Simon & Schuster","segments":["5c29eb67b486852b17dfc183","5c29eb67b486852b17dfc184","5c29eb67b486852b17dfc185","5c29eb67b486852b17dfc186"],"year":"1970","zh_author":"拉里 麦克默特里","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"继续前进"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.82],"goodreads_ratings":[1143],"year":["1970"],"zh_bookname":["继续前进"],"author":["Larry McMurtry"],"zh_author":["拉里 麦克默特里"],"bookname":["Moving On"]}}

He didn't leave a phone number. And he didn't plan on coming back - ever. In Wisconsin, Rico could blend in. His light hair and lighter skin wouldn't make him the \"dark dude\" or the punching bag for the whole neighborhood. The Midwest is the land of milk and honey, but for Rico Fuentes, it's really a last resort. Trading Harlem for Wisconsin, though, means giving up on a big part of his identity. And when Rico no longer has to prove that he's Latino, he almost stops being one.

While The Emperor of All Maladies is rich with the science and history behind the fight against cancer, it is also a meditation on illness, medical ethics, and the complex, intertwining lives of doctors and patients. Mukherjee's profound compassion--for cancer patients, their families, as well as the oncologists who, all too often, can offer little hope--makes this book a very human history of an elusive and complicated disease. --Lynette Mong From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Mukherjee's debut book is a sweeping epic of obsession, brilliant researchers, dramatic new treatments, euphoric success and tragic failure, and the relentless battle by scientists and patients alike against an equally relentless, wily, and elusive enemy. From the first chemotherapy developed from textile dyes to the possibilities emerging from our understanding of cancer cells, Mukherjee shapes a massive amount of history into a coherent story with a roller-coaster trajectory: the discovery of a new treatment--surgery, radiation, chemotherapy--followed by the notion that if a little is good, more must be better, ending in disfiguring radical mastectomy and multidrug chemo so toxic the treatment ended up being almost worse than the disease. The first part of the book is driven by the obsession of Sidney Farber and philanthropist Mary Lasker to find a unitary cure for all cancers. (Farber developed the first successful chemotherapy for childhood leukemia.) The last and most exciting part is driven by the race of brilliant, maverick scientists to understand how cells become cancerous. Each new discovery was small, but as Mukherjee, a Columbia professor of medicine, writes, \"Incremental advances can add up to transformative changes.\" Mukherjee's formidable intelligence and compassion produce a stunning account of the effort to disrobe the \"emperor of maladies.\" (Nov.)

Yeats's The Tower, first published in 1928 and later revised a number of times, arrived in its final form after many years of dedicated labor. Yeats here is concerned with the \"rooting of mythology in the earth,\" binding almost every poem to the image of Thoor Ballylee, the building in the west of Ireland that he saw as a permanent symbol of his work. Still considered one of the seminal volumes of modern poetry, its themes are both intensely personal and determinedly universal: old age and its attendant problems, the relationship between Nature and Art, the natural and the supernatural or spiritual, the self and the world. In her unsigned review of the collection, Virginia Woolf was to declare, \"Mr Yeats has never written more exactly and more passionately.\" Yet the poet was never satisfied, and in this volume we can trace the alterations, some subtle and others startling, of the hard-earned technique resulting in such major works as \"Sailing to Byzantium,\" \"Among School Children,\" \"Leda and the Swan,\" and \"Meditations in Time of Civil War.\" Materials include transcriptions and photographs of the earliest recoverable drafts and selected transcriptions from the most interesting manuscripts and annotated typescripts.

If...we could ask and it could reply, it would give up to us the most intimate secrets of life. -from Chapter II Anticipating not only modern scientific theories of psychology but also those of cosmology, this astonishing book sets out a impressive goal for itself: to reconcile human biology with a theory of consciousness. First published in France in 1907, and translated into English in 1911, this work of wonder was esteemed at the time in scientific circles and in the popular culture alike for its profound explorations of perception and memory and its surprising conclusions about the nature and value of art. Contending that intuition is deeper than intellect and that the real consequence of evolution is a mental freedom to grow, to change, to seek and create novelty, Bergson reinvigorated the theory of evolution by refusing to see it as merely mechanistic. His expansion on Darwin remains one of the most original and important philosophical arguments for a scientific inquiry still under fire today. French philosopher HENRI BERGSON (1859-1941) was born in Paris. Among his works are Matter and Memory (1896), An Introduction to Metaphysics (1903), and The Two Sources of Morality and Religion (1932).

The optimist in question is 71-year-old Judge McKelva, who has come to a New Orleans hospital from Mount Salus, Mississippi, complaining of a \"disturbance\" in his vision. To his daughter, Laurel, it's as rare for him to admit \"self-concern\" as it is for him to be sick, and she immediately flies down from Chicago to be by his side. The subsequent operation on the judge's eye goes well, but the recovery does not. He lies still with both eyes heavily bandaged, growing ever more passive until finally--with some help from the shockingly vulgar Fay, his wife of two years--he simply dies. Together Fay and Laurel travel to Mount Salus to bury him, and the novel begins the inward spiral that leads Laurel to the moment when \"all she had found had found her,\" when the \"deepest spring in her heart had uncovered itself\" and begins to flow again. Not much actually happens in the rest of the book--Fay's low-rent relatives arrive for the funeral, a bird flies down the chimney and is trapped in the hall--and yet Welty manages to compress the richness of an entire life within its pages. This is a world, after all, in which a set of complex relationships can be conveyed by the phrase \"I know his whole family\" or by the criticism \"When he brought her here to your house, she had very little idea of how to separate an egg.\" Does such a place exist anymore? It is vanishing even from this novel, and the personification of its vanishing is none other than Fay--petulant, graceless, childish, with neither the passion nor the imagination to love. Welty expends a lot of vindictive energy on Fay and her kin, who must be the most small-minded, mean-mouthed clan since the Snopeses hit Frenchman's Bend. There's more than just class snobbery at work here (though that surely comes into it too). As Welty sees it, they are a special historical tribe who exult in grieving because they have come to be good at it, and who seethe with resentment from the day they are born. They have come \"out of all times of trouble, past or future--the great, interrelated family of those who never know the meaning of what has happened to them.\" Fay belongs to the future, as she makes clear; it's Laurel who belongs to the past--Welty's own chosen territory. In her fine memoir, One Writer's Beginnings , Welty described the way art could shine a light back \"as when your train makes a curve, showing that there has been a mountain of meaning rising behind you on the way you've come.\" Here, in one of her most autobiographical works, the past joins seamlessly with the present in a masterful evocation of grief, memory, loss, and love. Beautifully written, moving but never mawkish, The Optimist's Daughter is Eudora Welty's greatest achievement--which is high praise indeed. --Mary Park Review Pulitzer Prize-winning short novel by Eudora Welty, published in 1972. This partially autobiographical story explores the subtle bonds between parent and child and the complexities of love and grief. --","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd91b48685135a2103aa.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":2,"publisher":"Vintage","segments":["5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e1","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e2","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e3","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e4","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e5","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e6","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e7","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e8","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1e9","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1ea","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1eb","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1ec","5c29e43ab486852b17dca1ed"],"year":"1972","zh_author":"韦尔蒂","zh_bookname":"乐观者的女儿"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1972"],"zh_bookname":["乐观者的女儿"],"author":["Eudora Welty"],"zh_author":["韦尔蒂"],"bookname":["The Optimist's Daughter"]}}

The titular Oscar is a 300-pound-plus \"lovesick ghetto nerd\" with zero game (except for Dungeons &amp; Dragons) who cranks out pages of fantasy fiction with the hopes of becoming a Dominican J.R.R. Tolkien. The book is also the story of a multi-generational family curse that courses through the book, leaving troubles and tragedy in its wake. This was the most dynamic, entertaining, and achingly heartfelt novel I've read in a long time. My head is still buzzing with the memory of dozens of killer passages that I dog-eared throughout the book. The rope-a-dope narrative is funny, hip, tragic, soulful, and bursting with desire. Make some room for Oscar Wao on your bookshelf--you won't be disappointed. --Brad Thomas Parsons From Publishers Weekly Signature_Reviewed by_ Matthew SharpeAreader might at first be surprised by how many chapters of a book entitled The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao are devoted not to its sci fi and fantasy-gobbling nerd-hero but to his sister, his mother and his grandfather. However, Junot Diaz's dark and exuberant first novel makes a compelling case for the multiperspectival view of a life, wherein an individual cannot be known or understood in isolation from the history of his family and his nation.Oscar being a first-generation Dominican-American, the nation in question is really two nations. And Dominicans in this novel being explicitly of mixed Ta?no, African and Spanish descent, the very ideas of nationhood and nationality are thoughtfully, subtly complicated. The various nationalities and generations are subtended by the recurring motif of fuk? , the Curse and Doom of the New World, whose midwife and... victim was a historical personage Diaz will only call the Admiral, in deference to the belief that uttering his name brings bad luck (hint: he arrived in the New World in 1492 and his initials are CC). By the prologue's end, it's clear that this story of one poor guy's cursed life will also be the story of how 500 years of historical and familial bad luck shape the destiny of its fat, sad, smart, lovable and short-lived protagonist. The book's pervasive sense of doom is offset by a rich and playful prose that embodies its theme of multiple nations, cultures and languages, often shifting in a single sentence from English to Spanish, from Victorian formality to Negropolitan vernacular, from Homeric epithet to dirty bilingual insult. Even the presumed reader shape-shifts in the estimation of its in-your-face narrator, who addresses us variously as folks, you folks, conspiracy-minded-fools, Negro, Nigger and plataneros. So while Diaz assumes in his reader the same considerable degree of multicultural erudition he himself possesses offering no gloss on his many un-italicized Spanish words and expressions (thus beautifully dramatizing how linguistic borders, like national ones, are porous), or on his plethora of genre and canonical literary allusions he does helpfully footnote aspects of Dominican history, especially those concerning the bloody 30-year reign of President Rafael Le?nidas Trujillo. The later Oscar chapters lack the linguistic brio of the others, and there are exposition-clogged passages that read like summaries of a longer narrative, but mostly this fierce, funny, tragic book is just what a reader would have hoped for in a novel by Junot Diaz.__Matthew Sharpe is the author of the novels Jamestown and The Sleeping Father .

Casement had dedicated his extraordinary life to improving the plight of oppressed peoples around the world especially the native populations in the Belgian Congo and the Amazon but when he dared to draw a parallel between the injustices he witnessed in African and American colonies and those committed by the British in Northern Ireland, he became involved in a cause that led to his imprisonment and execution. Ultimately, the scandals surrounding Casement's trial and eventual hanging tainted his image to such a degree that his pioneering human rights work wasn't fully reexamined until the 1960s. In The Dream of the Celt , Mario Vargas Llosa, who has long been regarded as one of Latin America's most vibrant, provocative, and necessary literary voices a fact confirmed when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010 brings this complex character to life as no other writer can. A masterful work, sharply translated by Edith Grossman, The Dream of the Celt tackles a controversial man whose story has long been neglected, and, in so doing, pushes at the boundaries of the historical novel.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd33b48685135a1ecd81.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.72,"goodreads_ratings":5205,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e02bb486852b17dadebe","5c29e02bb486852b17dadebf","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec0","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec1","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec2","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec3","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec4","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec5","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec6","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec7","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec8","5c29e02bb486852b17dadec9","5c29e02bb486852b17dadeca","5c29e02bb486852b17dadecb","5c29e02bb486852b17dadecc"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"凯尔特人之梦"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.72],"goodreads_ratings":[5205],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["凯尔特人之梦"],"author":["Mario Vargas Llosa"],"zh_author":["马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨"],"bookname":["The Dream of the Celt"]}}

In a candid and perceptive forward to this collection of early writing, Vargas llosa provides background to the volume and a unique glimpse into the mind of the Nobel Prize-winning artist.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddfcb48685135a2391e2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.51,"goodreads_ratings":2144,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e8c0b486852b17de9db5","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9db6","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9db7","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9db8","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9db9","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dba","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dbb","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dbc","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dbd","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dbe","5c29e8c0b486852b17de9dbf"],"year":"","zh_author":"马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"小熊和其他故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.51],"goodreads_ratings":[2144],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["小熊和其他故事"],"author":["Mario Vargas Llosa"],"zh_author":["马里奥 巴尔加斯 略萨"],"bookname":["The Cubs and Other Stories"]}}

In this boldly ambitious and symphonic novel, she captures the tenor of our times and offers an unsettling glimpse of the future. Fashion model Charlotte Swenson returns to Manhattan, having just recovered from a catastrophic car accident in her hometown of Rockford, Illinois. The skin of her face is perfect, but behind it lie eighty titanium screws that hold together the bones that were shattered when she hit the unbreakable windscreen of her car. Unrecognizable to her peers and colleagues, Charlotte finds it impossible to resume her former life. Instead, she floats invisibly through a world of fashion nightclubs and edgy Internet projects, where image and reality are indistinguishable. During her recovery in Rockford, she had met another Charlotte, the plain-looking teenage daughter of her former best friend. Young Charlotte, alienated from parents and friends, has come under the sway of two men: her uncle, a mentally unstable scholar of the Industrial Revolution, and an enigmatic high school teacher whom she seduces. In following these tales to their eerie convergence, Look at Me is both a send-up of image culture in America and a mystery of human identity. Egan illuminates the difficulties of shaping an inner life in a culture obsessed with surfaces and asks whether \"truth\" can have any meaning in an era when reality itself has become a style. Written with powerful intelligence and grace, Look at Me clearly establishes Jennifer Egan as one of the most daring and gifted novelists of her generation.

For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the \"essential dimensions\" of human nature, manifested in man's timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history. And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times.

All the King's Men tells the story of Willie Stark, a southern-fried politician who builds support by appealing to the common man and playing dirty politics with the best of the back-room deal-makers. Though Stark quickly sheds his idealism, his right-hand man, Jack Burden -- who narrates the story -- retains it and proves to be a thorn in the new governor's side. Stark becomes a successful leader, but at a very high price, one that eventually costs him his life.

Originally written in French, Beckett translated the work himself, and in doing so chose to revise and eliminate various passages. With side-by-side text the reader can experience the mastery of Beckett's language and explore the nuances of his creativity.

The novel was awarded the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The Caine Mutiny grew out of Wouk's experiences aboard a destroyer-minesweeper in the Pacific in World War II. The novel focuses on Willie Keith, a rich New Yorker assigned to the USS Caine, who gradually matures during the course of the book. But the work is best known for its portrayal of the neurotic Captain Queeg, who becomes obsessed with petty infractions at the expense of the safety of ship and crew. Cynical, intellectual Lieutenant Tom Keefer persuades loyal Lieutenant Steve Maryk that Queeg's bizarre behavior is endangering the ship; Maryk reluctantly relieves Queeg of command. Much of the book describes Maryk's court-martial and its aftermath. The unstable Queeg eventually breaks down completely. -- __ Product Description Each decade new readers discover the characters and curious activities aboard the U.S.S.

He was first a radio scriptwriter, and worked with Fred Allen, then in 1941 worked for the US government on radio spots selling war bonds. Wouk then joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater, an experience he later characterized as educational; ''I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.'' His first ship was the USS Zane, then he was second-in-command on the Southard. He started his writing career onboard, working on a novel during his off-duty hours. He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons, became a fulltime writer in 1946, and published his debut novel, Aurora Dawn in 1947.

But Mark Bramhall's comparative youth is soon forgotten as he leads us into the saga of intertwined generations. His pacing, his characterizations, and his convincing emotional repertoire embed us in this 1971 Pulitzer Prize winner that is in no way dated. Stegner's heroine is Ward's grandmother, Susan Burling Ward, a 19th-century writer and artist living in the rough mining towns of the West with her idealistic engineer husband. Bramhall's Susan is sometimes too girlish, but this, too, is a small matter; overall, he offers us a fine reading of a superb book. <div class=\"bookitem","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de1cb48685135a246f12.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.27,"goodreads_ratings":45257,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ea38b486852b17df4276","5c29ea38b486852b17df4277","5c29ea38b486852b17df4278","5c29ea38b486852b17df4279","5c29ea38b486852b17df427a","5c29ea38b486852b17df427b","5c29ea38b486852b17df427c","5c29ea38b486852b17df427d","5c29ea38b486852b17df427e","5c29ea38b486852b17df427f","5c29ea38b486852b17df4280","5c29ea38b486852b17df4281","5c29ea38b486852b17df4282","5c29ea38b486852b17df4283","5c29ea38b486852b17df4284","5c29ea38b486852b17df4285","5c29ea38b486852b17df4286","5c29ea38b486852b17df4287","5c29ea38b486852b17df4288","5c29ea38b486852b17df4289","5c29ea38b486852b17df428a","5c29ea38b486852b17df428b","5c29ea38b486852b17df428c","5c29ea38b486852b17df428d","5c29ea38b486852b17df428e","5c29ea38b486852b17df428f","5c29ea38b486852b17df4290","5c29ea38b486852b17df4291","5c29ea38b486852b17df4292","5c29ea38b486852b17df4293","5c29ea38b486852b17df4294","5c29ea38b486852b17df4295","5c29ea38b486852b17df4296","5c29ea38b486852b17df4297","5c29ea38b486852b17df4298","5c29ea38b486852b17df4299","5c29ea38b486852b17df429a","5c29ea38b486852b17df429b","5c29ea38b486852b17df429c","5c29ea38b486852b17df429d","5c29ea38b486852b17df429e","5c29ea38b486852b17df429f","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a0","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a1","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a2","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a3","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a4","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a5","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a6","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a7","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a8","5c29ea38b486852b17df42a9"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"斯蒂格","zh_bookname":"休止角"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.27],"goodreads_ratings":[45257],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["休止角"],"author":["Wallace Stegner"],"zh_author":["斯蒂格"],"bookname":["Angle of Repose"]}}

The Eternal Wonder tells the coming-of-age story of Randolph Colfax (Rann for short), an extraordinarily gifted young man whose search for meaning and purpose leads him to New York, England, Paris, a mission patrolling the DMZ in Korea that will change his life foreverand, ultimately, to love. Rann falls for the beautiful and equally brilliant Stephanie Kung, who lives in Paris with her Chinese father and has no contact with her American mother, who abandoned the family when Stephanie was six years old. Both Rann and Stephanie yearn for a sense of genuine identity. Rann feels plagued by his voracious intellectual curiosity and strives to integrate his life of the mind with his experience in the world. Stephanie feels alienated from society by her mixed heritage and struggles to resolve the culture clash of her existence. Separated for long periods of time, their final reunion leads to a conclusion that even Rann, in all his hard-earned wisdom, could never have imagined. A moving and mesmerizing fictional exploration of the themes that meant so much to Pearl S. Buck in her life, this final work is perhaps her most personal and passionate, and will no doubt appeal to the millions of readers who have treasured her novels for generations.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd04b48685135a1d70cc.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.53,"goodreads_ratings":1945,"level":2,"publisher":"Open Road Media","segments":["5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb13","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb14","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb15","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb16","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb17","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb18","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb19","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1a","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1b","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1c","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1d","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1e","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb1f","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb20","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb21","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb22","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb23","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb24","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb25","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb26","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb27","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb28","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb29","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb2a","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb2b","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb2c","5c29dd8fb486852b17d9cb2d"],"year":"2013","zh_author":"赛珍珠","zh_bookname":"永恒的奇迹"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.53],"goodreads_ratings":[1945],"year":["2013"],"zh_bookname":["永恒的奇迹"],"author":["Pearl S Buck"],"zh_author":["赛珍珠"],"bookname":["The Eternal Wonder"]}}

Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. \"Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.\"","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd33b48685135a1ecf4f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.05,"goodreads_ratings":2095,"level":1,"publisher":"Moyer Bell","segments":["5c29e030b486852b17dae020","5c29e030b486852b17dae021","5c29e030b486852b17dae022","5c29e030b486852b17dae023","5c29e030b486852b17dae024","5c29e030b486852b17dae025","5c29e030b486852b17dae026","5c29e030b486852b17dae027","5c29e030b486852b17dae028","5c29e030b486852b17dae029","5c29e030b486852b17dae02a","5c29e030b486852b17dae02b","5c29e030b486852b17dae02c","5c29e030b486852b17dae02d","5c29e030b486852b17dae02e","5c29e030b486852b17dae02f","5c29e030b486852b17dae030","5c29e030b486852b17dae031","5c29e030b486852b17dae032","5c29e030b486852b17dae033"],"year":"1946","zh_author":"赛珍珠","zh_bookname":"龙种"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.05],"goodreads_ratings":[2095],"year":["1946"],"zh_bookname":["龙种"],"author":["Pearl S Buck"],"zh_author":["赛珍珠"],"bookname":["Dragon Seed"]}}

A forerunner of its kind, the memoir was published in 1950 and helped demolish the cruel taboos surrounding learning disabilities. Buck describes life with her daughter, Carol, whose special needs led Buck to send her to one of the best schools for disabled children in the United States which she paid for in part by writing The Good Earth , her multimillion-selling classic novel. Brave and touching, The Child Who Never Grew is a heartrending memoir of parenting. As Buck writes, I learned respect and reverence for every human mind.

I shall not undertake to relate-it again; but, having become acquainted with several memoirs of the time which have remained unpublished, I discovered some anecdotes relating to King Cloche and Queen Satine, whose daughter it was that slept a hundred years, and also to several members of the Court who shared the Princess's sleep. I propose to communicate to the public such portions of these revelations as have seemed to me most interesting. After several years of marriage, Queen Satine gave the King, her husband, a daughter who received the names of Paule-Marie-Aurore. The baptismal festivities were planned by the Duc des Hoisons, grand master of the ceremonies, in accordance with a formulary dating from the Emperor Honorius, which was so mildewed and so nibbled by rats that it was impossible to decipher any of it. There were still fairies in those days, and those who had titles used to go to Court. Seven of them were invited to be god-mothers, Queen Titania, Queen Mab, the wise Vivien, trained by Merlin in the arts of enchantment, Melusina, whose history was written by Jean d'Arras, and who became a serpent every Saturday (but the baptism was on a Sunday), Urg le, White Anna of Brittany, and Mourgue who led Ogier the Dane into the country of Avalon. They appeared at the castle in robes of the colour of time, of the sun, of the moon, and of the nymphs, all glittering with diamonds and pearls. As all were taking their places at table an old fairy called Alcuine, who had not been invited, was seen to enter. &quot;Pray do not be annoyed, madame,&quot; said the King, &quot;that you were not of those invited to this festivity; it was believed that you were either dead or enchanted.&quot; Since the fairies grew old, there is no doubt that they used to die. They all died in time, and everybody knows that Melusina became a kitchen wench in Hell. By means of enchantment they could be imprisoned in a magic circle, a tree, a bush, or a stone, or changed into a statue, a hind, a dove, a footstool, a ring, or a slipper. But as a fact it was not because they thought her dead or enchanted that they had not invited the fairy Alcuine; it was because her presence at the banquet had been regarded as contrary to etiquette. Madame de Maintenon was able to state without the least exaggeration that &quot;there are no austerities in the convents like those to which Court etiquette subjects the great.&quot; In accordance with his sovereign's royal wish the Duc des Hoisons had not invited the fairy Alcuine, because she had one quartering of nobility too few to be admitted to Court. When the Ministers of State represented that it was of the utmost importance to humour this powerful and vindictive fairy, of whom they would make a dangerous enemy if they excluded her from the festivities, the King replied in peremptory tones that she could not be invited, as she was not qualified by birth.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd71b48685135a2019f2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":2.33,"goodreads_ratings":3,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e283b486852b17dbe507"],"year":"","zh_author":"阿纳托尔 法朗士","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"CICONE公爵夫人和Monsieur De Boulingrin的故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[2.33],"goodreads_ratings":[3],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["CICONE公爵夫人和Monsieur De Boulingrin的故事"],"author":["Anatole France"],"zh_author":["阿纳托尔 法朗士"],"bookname":["The Story Of The Duchess Of Cicogne And Of Monsieur De Boulingrin"]}}

George F. Babbitt, Lewis's outwardly successful but inwardly unhappy real estate salesman, still seems real. His story makes engrossing reading and is ideal for audio listening. With Babbitt himself at the center of every scene, it is impossible for listeners plagued by frequent interruptions to lose track of the story line. Narrator Wolfram Kandinsky has a voice that many listeners may find grating; however, his reading here conveys an appropriate ironic tone that is especially apt when he reads Babbitt's own lines.

Review First published in 1922, Babbitt is an authentic modern American classic, a biting satire of middle-American values that retains much of its poignancy today. George F. Babbitt, Lewis's outwardly successful but inwardly unhappy real estate salesman, still seems real. His story makes engrossing reading and is ideal for audio listening. With Babbitt himself at the center of every scene, it is impossible for listeners plagued by frequent interruptions to lose track of the story line. Narrator Wolfram Kandinsky has a voice that many listeners may find grating; however, his reading here conveys an appropriate ironic tone that is especially apt when he reads Babbitt's own lines. Recommended for general fiction collections. Kent Rasmussen, Thousand Oaks, CA (_Library Journal_ ) ''[It is] by its hardness, its efficiency, its compactness that Mr. Lewis's work excels.''

This highly experimental device produces a kind of biographical dictionary, whose individual entries come together to paint a vivid portrait of life in Cairo from a range of perspectives. The characters include representatives of every class and human type and as the intricate family saga unfolds, a powerful picture of a society in transition emerges. This is a tale of change and continuity, of the death of a traditional way of life and the road to independence and beyond, seen through the eyes of Egypt's citizens.

While the novel focuses on a willful young woman whose ambition to escape the confines of the alley leads her into prostitution, a pageant of other vivid characters, from the cafe owner who likes boys to the man who creates maimed beggars and from the young man with the faithful heart to the rake and the pimp, fleshes out the picture of a society in crisis and transition. Though set during the Second World War, the characters' alienation from the prevailing political system and the desire of many of them to escape the economic and social stagnation of the alley give the work an unexpectedly up-to-date flavor. Mahfouz presents his characters with wry humor and a relish for the contradictions and fallibilities innate in people everywhere (even the alley's beloved spiritual mentor beats his wife). This new translation of one the writer's best known works has been undertaken to celebrate the centenary of his birth on 11 December 2011.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de55b48685135a25ae83.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.84,"goodreads_ratings":7322,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ecaab486852b17e04a2f","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a30","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a31","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a32","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a33","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a34","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a35","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a36","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a37","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a38","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a39","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3a","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3b","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3c","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3d","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3e","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a3f","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a40","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a41","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a42","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a43","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a44","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a45","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a46","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a47","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a48","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a49","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4a","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4b","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4c","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4d","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4e","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a4f","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a50","5c29ecaab486852b17e04a51"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"纳吉布 马哈福兹","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"Midaq胡同"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.84],"goodreads_ratings":[7322],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["Midaq胡同"],"author":["Naguib Mahfouz"],"zh_author":["纳吉布 马哈福兹"],"bookname":["Midaq Alley"]}}

But it's a mistake to approach Cheever as if he were merely some sort of anthropologist documenting the customs of an obscure and vanishing tribe. Nostalgia and class issues aside, his true subject is the darkness hidden beneath the surface of postwar American life. A case in point is his famous story \"The Swimmer,\" in which an ebullient Neddy Merrill decides to swim home across the backyard pools of his neighbors. In the course of his journey, however, summer gives way to autumn, his neighbors turn against him, there are troubling intimations of disgrace and financial ruin, and he arrives to find his house both locked and empty. Though these stories deal with bright, prosperous, ostensibly happy people, a cold wind blows through them. Age, illness, financial embarrassment, sex, alcohol, death--all of these threaten his suburban Eden. (Is it himself Cheever is mocking in his ironic \"The Worm in the Apple\"? \"Everyone in the community with wandering hands had given them both a try but they had been put off. What was the source of this constancy? Were they frightened? Were they prudish? Were they monogamous? What was at the bottom of this appearance of happiness?\") Inanimate objects carry the residue of their past owners' unhappiness and cruelty (\"Seaside Houses,\" \"The Lowboy\"); expatriates long for but cannot quite find their way home (\"The Woman Without A Country,\" \"Boy in Rome\"); children vanish or turn out badly (too many stories to count). All of this is conveyed in prose both graceful and tender. No one is better than Cheever at describing a character's appearance: \"He was a cheerful, heavy man with a round face that looked exactly like a pudding. Everyone was glad to see him, as one is glad to see, at the end of a meal, the appearance of a bland, fragrant, and nourishing dish made of fresh eggs, nutmeg, and country cream.\" Given his uncanny eye (and ear) for realistic description, it's easy to forget how experimental Cheever could be. His later stories pioneered authorial intrusions in the best postmodern style, and from the beginning, he wrote what would much later be called magical realism. (Think of the sinister broadcasts in \"The Enormous Radio,\" or the phantom love interest in \"The Chimera.\") A literary event at its publication and winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1979, The Stories of John Cheever remains a stunning and enormously influential book. --Mary Park Review \"Cheever has created a universe of unforgettable people, places and things.\" - Chicago Sun-Times \"Profound and daring...some of the most wonderful stories any American has written.\" - The Boston Globe From the Trade Paperback edition.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd62b48685135a1ff1eb.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.27,"goodreads_ratings":13071,"level":2,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e23db486852b17dbc456","5c29e23db486852b17dbc457","5c29e23db486852b17dbc458","5c29e23db486852b17dbc459","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45a","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45b","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45c","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45d","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45e","5c29e23db486852b17dbc45f","5c29e23db486852b17dbc460","5c29e23db486852b17dbc461","5c29e23db486852b17dbc462","5c29e23db486852b17dbc463","5c29e23db486852b17dbc464","5c29e23db486852b17dbc465","5c29e23db486852b17dbc466","5c29e23db486852b17dbc467","5c29e23db486852b17dbc468","5c29e23db486852b17dbc469","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46a","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46b","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46c","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46d","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46e","5c29e23db486852b17dbc46f","5c29e23db486852b17dbc470","5c29e23db486852b17dbc471","5c29e23db486852b17dbc472","5c29e23db486852b17dbc473","5c29e23db486852b17dbc474","5c29e23db486852b17dbc475","5c29e23db486852b17dbc476","5c29e23db486852b17dbc477","5c29e23db486852b17dbc478","5c29e23db486852b17dbc479","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47a","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47b","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47c","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47d","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47e","5c29e23db486852b17dbc47f","5c29e23db486852b17dbc480","5c29e23db486852b17dbc481"],"year":"1982","zh_author":"约翰 契佛","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"约翰契弗短篇"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.27],"goodreads_ratings":[13071],"year":["1982"],"zh_bookname":["约翰契弗短篇"],"author":["John Cheever"],"zh_author":["约翰 契佛"],"bookname":["The Stories of John Cheever"]}}

Then the murders, which happened later. In 1956, Dell Parsons' family came to a stop in Great Falls, Montana, the way many military families did following the war. His father, Bev, was a talkative, plank-shouldered man, an airman from Alabama with an optimistic and easy-scheming nature. Dell and his twin sister, Berner, could easily see why their mother might have been attracted to him. But their mother Neeva - from an educated, immigrant, Jewish family - was shy, artistic and alienated from their father's small-town world of money scrapes and living on-the-fly.

Ma la scarna semplicit della sua lingua, la linearit delle narrazioni, la capacit di costruire sto rie che, come Misteri medievali, hanno per soggetto le avventure dell anima e per teatro lo spazio fra la terra e il cielo, pongono Lagerkvist nel numero dei classici per i quali giunge, prima o poi, il momento della rilettura. Due storie si intrecciano in Pellegrino sul mare: quella di Tobias, che parte per la Terra Santa imbarcandosi su una nave pirata, e quella di Giovanni, il vecchio marinaio che da anni percorre il mare perseguitato dal doloroso ricordo di una pas sione impossibile. Ma esiste la Terra Santa? Esiste una pace, una fede che giustifichi la nostra vita? Esi ste l amore perfetto? Sullo sfondo della violenza e della brutalit della vita di bordo e dell inquieta e indifferente presenza del mare, nessuna risposta possibile. l assenza la condizione umana, la sepa razione, la mancanza, come testimonia il medaglione vuoto che i personaggi di Lagerkvist si passano da un romanzo all altro. I suoi ebrei erranti, le sue sibille, i vagabondi ricercatori di Dio e della verit , portano sempre dentro di s quella nostalgia per una patria mai avuta e quella tensione verso un improbabile terra promessa che sono nel fondo di tutti.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd19b48685135a1e0438.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.88,"goodreads_ratings":190,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29deb6b486852b17da39df","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e0","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e1","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e2","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e3","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e4","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e5","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e6","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e7","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e8","5c29deb6b486852b17da39e9","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ea","5c29deb6b486852b17da39eb","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ec","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ed","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ee","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ef","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f0","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f1","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f2","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f3","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f4","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f5","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f6","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f7","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f8","5c29deb6b486852b17da39f9","5c29deb6b486852b17da39fa","5c29deb6b486852b17da39fb","5c29deb6b486852b17da39fc","5c29deb6b486852b17da39fd","5c29deb6b486852b17da39fe","5c29deb6b486852b17da39ff","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a00","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a01","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a02","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a03","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a04","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a05","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a06","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a07","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a08","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a09","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a0a","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a0b","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a0c","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a0d","5c29deb6b486852b17da3a0e"],"year":"","zh_author":"拉格奎斯维特","zh_bookname":"Sea朝圣者"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.88],"goodreads_ratings":[190],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["Sea朝圣者"],"author":["Par Lagerkvist"],"zh_author":["拉格奎斯维特"],"bookname":["Pilgrim at Sea"]}}

While just as apathetic to judgement and distinct conclusions as the rest of the pentalogy, this one gives us a bit more understanding of how to journey through the fog that Lagerkvist's books tend to be. The whole point is to journey, that the goal might not be reachable. Kafka once wrote, \"The whole visible world is perhaps nothing more than than the rationalization of a man who wants to find peace for a moment. An attempt to falsify the actuality of knowledge, to regard knowledge as a goal still to be reached.\" This pentalogy extends this further than one could think. What does that peace mean? How can one attain it? What is the knowledge one attempts to falsify, what is to be still reached? And even more important than those questions, the most important word of that quote is \"perhaps\". Perhaps this is simply wrong and we are misinterpreting the entirety. Lagerkvist's tales give us something to think about, a what if. Even if no absolute opinion is given by the author, at least he gives a path to walk on for a while, to perhaps find rest from other ideas.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd77b48685135a20466c.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.86,"goodreads_ratings":127,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e74","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e75","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e76","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e77","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e78","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e79","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7a","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7b","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7c","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7d","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7e","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e7f","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e80","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e81","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e82","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e83","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e84","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e85","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e86","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e87","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e88","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e89","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8a","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8b","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8c","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8d","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8e","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e8f","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e90","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e91","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e92","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e93","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e94","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e95","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e96","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e97","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e98","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e99","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9a","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9b","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9c","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9d","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9e","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0e9f","5c29e2e2b486852b17dc0ea0"],"year":"","zh_author":"拉格奎斯维特","zh_bookname":"圣地"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.86],"goodreads_ratings":[127],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["圣地"],"author":["Par Lagerkvist"],"zh_author":["拉格奎斯维特"],"bookname":["The Holy Land"]}}

But when it comes to love stories, things are simpler. A love story can never be about full possession. Love stories depend on disappointment, on unequal births and feuding families, on matrimonial boredom and at least one cold heart. Love stories, nearly without exception, give love a bad name.... It is perhaps only in reading a love story (or in writing one) that we can simultaneously partake of the ecstasy and agony of being in love without paying a crippling emotional price.

One was Muhammad Ali, the aging but irrepressible professor of boxing. The other was George Foreman, who was as taciturn as Ali was voluble. Observing them was Norman Mailer, a commentator of unparalleled energy, acumen, and audacity. Whether he is analyzing the fighters moves, interpreting their characters, or weighing their competing claims on the African and American souls, Mailer s grasp of the titanic battle s feints and stratagems and his sensitivity to their deeper symbolism makes this book a masterpiece of the literature of sport. Praise for *The Fight Exquisitely refined and attenuated . . . [a] sensitive portrait of an extraordinary athlete and man, and a pugilistic drama fully as exciting as the reality on which it is based. * The New York Times One of the defining texts of sports journalism. Not only does Mailer recall the violent combat with a scholar s eye . . . he also makes the whole act of reporting seem as exciting as what s occurring in the ring. GQ Stylistically, Mailer was the greatest boxing writer of all time. * Chuck Klosterman, Esquire One of Mailer s finest books. Louis Menand, *The New Yorker Praise for Norman Mailer [Norman Mailer] loomed over American letters longer and larger than any other writer of his generation. * The New York Times A writer of the greatest and most reckless talent. The New Yorker Mailer is indispensable, an American treasure. * The Washington Post A devastatingly alive and original creative mind. *Life Mailer is fierce, courageous, and reckless and nearly everything he writes has sections of headlong brilliance. * The New York Review of Books The largest mind and imagination [in modern] American literature . . . Unlike just about every American writer since Henry James, Mailer has managed to grow and become richer in wisdom with each new book. *Chicago Tribune Mailer is a master of his craft. His language carries you through the story like a leaf on a stream. * The Cincinnati Post Amazon.com Review There are sporting events that transcend the world of sports, and the 1974 heavyweight title fight in which Muhammad Ali regained his crown by improbably kayoing George Foreman in the middle of the African night was certainly one of them. Metaphorically, it was a writer's dream: two imposing black warriors, one all grace, the other brute force, one the iconoclast, the other the blind patriot, battling each other. Fatefully, the appropriate writer threw his pen into the ring. Norman Mailer's masterful account goes far beyond the ropes to capture the primal ethos of the sport, the larger social canvas this particular fight was drawn on, and the remarkable cast of personalities--not the least of which is Mailer himself--who converged to make this \"Rumble in the Jungle\" a landmark in sports history and a clear knockout in Mailer's journalistic portfolio. From Library Journal The \"fight\" is the 1975 world heavyweight championship bout in Zaire between then reigning king of the ring Muhammad Ali and up-and-coming George Foreman. Mailer relays the events of the actual fight and includes the observations of George Plimpton, Hunter S. Thompson, and others.

Harding's outstanding debut unfurls the history and final thoughts of a dying grandfather surrounded by his family in his New England home. George Washington Crosby repairs clocks for a living and on his deathbed revisits his turbulent childhood as the oldest son of an epileptic smalltime traveling salesman. The descriptions of the father's epilepsy and the cold halo of chemical electricity that encircled him immediately before he was struck by a full seizure are stunning, and the household's sadness permeates the narrative as George returns to more melancholy scenes. The real star is Harding's language, which dazzles whether he's describing the workings of clocks, sensory images of nature, the many engaging side characters who populate the book, or even a short passage on how to build a bird nest. This is an especially gorgeous example of novelistic craftsmanship. (Jan.) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Booklist Starred Review A tinker is a mender, and in Harding s spellbinding debut, he imagines the old, mendable horse-and-carriage world. The objects of the past were more readily repaired than our electronics, but the living world was a mystery, as it still is, as it always will be. And so in this rhapsodic novel of impending death, Harding considers humankind s contrary desires to conquer the imps of disorder and to be one with life, fully meshed within the great glimmering web. In the present, George lies on his death bed in the Massachusetts house he built himself, surrounded by family and the antique clocks he restores. George loves the precision of fine timepieces, but now he is at the mercy of chaotic forces and seems to be channeling his late father, Howard, a tinker and a mystic whose epileptic seizures strike like lightning. Howard, in turn, remembers his strange and gentle minister father. Each man is extraordinarily porous to nature and prone to becoming unhitched from everyday human existence and entering a state of ecstasy, even transcendence.

Archy and his wife, Gwen, are expecting their first baby; Nat and Aviva have a teenaged son, Julius. Cranky, flawed and loving each other with all the fierceness we've come to expect of Chabon characters, Archy and Nat have worked to construct lives and livelihoods that have a groove, looking to connect across barriers of race and class, and clinging to a sense of order and security through their stubbornly old-school ways.

Now, once more mining the rich past, Chabon summons the rollicking spirit of legendary adventures - from The Arabian Nights to Alexandre Dumas to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser storie - in a wonderful new novel brimming with breathless action, raucous humor, cliff-hanging suspense, and a cast of colorful characters worthy of Scheherazade's most tantalizing tales. They're an odd pair, to be sure: pale, rail-thin, black-clad Zelikman, a moody, itinerant physician fond of jaunty headgear, and ex-soldier Amram, a gray-haired giant of a man as quick with a razor-tongued witticism as he is with a sharpened battle-ax. Brothers under the skin, comrades in arms, they make their rootless way through the Caucasus Mountains, circa A.D. 950, living as they please and surviving however they can - as blades and thieves for hire and as practiced bamboozlers, cheerfully separating the gullible from their money. No strangers to tight scrapes and close shaves, they've left many a fist shaking in their dust, tasted their share of enemy steel, and made good any number of hasty exits under hostile circumstances. None of which has necessarily prepared them to be dragooned into service as escorts and defenders to a prince of the Khazar Empire. Usurped by his brutal uncle, the callow and decidedly ill-tempered young royal burns to reclaim his rightful throne. But doing so will demand wicked cunning, outrageous daring, and foolhardy bravado . . . not to mention an army. Zelikman and Amram can at least supply the former. But are these gentlemen of the road prepared to become generals in a full-scale revolution? The only certainty is that getting there - along a path paved with warriors and whores, evil emperors and extraordinary elephants, secrets, swordplay, and such stuff as the grandest adventures are made of - will be much more than half the fun.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de1cb48685135a246bfb.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.42,"goodreads_ratings":12038,"level":4,"publisher":"Del Rey","segments":["5c29ea32b486852b17df3ff5","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ff6","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ff7","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ff8","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ff9","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ffa","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ffb","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ffc","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ffd","5c29ea32b486852b17df3ffe","5c29ea32b486852b17df3fff","5c29ea32b486852b17df4000","5c29ea32b486852b17df4001","5c29ea32b486852b17df4002","5c29ea32b486852b17df4003"],"year":"2006","zh_author":"米迦勒沙邦","zh_bookname":"路上的绅士"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.42],"goodreads_ratings":[12038],"year":["2006"],"zh_bookname":["路上的绅士"],"author":["Michael Chabon"],"zh_author":["米迦勒沙邦"],"bookname":["Gentlemen of the Road"]}}

Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature\".

These groundbreaking stories interconnected and juxtaposed using an experimental method Solzhenitsyn referred to as binary join Solzhenitsyn s already available work as some of the most powerful literature of the twentieth century. With Soviet and post-Soviet life as their focus, they weave and shift inside their shared setting, illuminating the Russian experience under the Soviet regime. In The Upcoming Generation, a professor promotes a dull but proletarian student purely out of good will. Years later, the same professor finds himself arrested and, in a striking twist of fate, his student becomes his interrogator. In Nastenka, two young women with the same name lead routine, ordered lives until the Revolution exacts radical change on them both. The most eloquent and acclaimed opponent of government oppression, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970, and his work continues to receive international acclaim. Available for the first time in English, Apricot Jam: And Other Stories is a striking example of Solzhenitsyn s singular style and only further solidifies his place as a true literary giant.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de50b48685135a2584ac.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.64,"goodreads_ratings":310,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ec53b486852b17e02673","5c29ec53b486852b17e02674"],"year":"","zh_author":"索尔仁尼琴","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"杏酱"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.64],"goodreads_ratings":[310],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["杏酱"],"author":["Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"],"zh_author":["索尔仁尼琴"],"bookname":["Apricot Jam"]}}

Though already a widely acclaimed novelist, the author of such modern classics as The Orchard Keeper and Child of God, McCarthy had never before written a screenplay. Using nothing more than a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre-Civil War industrialist as inspiration, the author and Pearce together roamed the mill towns of the South researching their subject. One year later McCarthy finished The Gardener's Son,a taut, riveting drama of impotence, rage, and ultimately violence spanning two generations of mill owners and workers, fathers and sons, during the rise and fall of one of America's most bizarre utopian industrial experiments. Produced as a two-hour film and broadcast on PBS in 1976, The Gardener's Son recieved two Emmy Award nominations and was shown at the Berlin and Edinburgh Film Festivals. This is the first appearance of the film script in book form. Set in Graniteville, South Carolina, The Gardener's Son is the tale of two families: the Greggs, a wealthy family that owns and operates the local cotton mill, and the McEvoys, a family of mill workers beset by misfortune. The action opens as Robert McEvoy, a young mill worker, is having his leg amputated -- the limb mangled in an accident rumored to have been caused by James Gregg, son of the mill's founder. McEvoy, crippled and isolated, grows into a man with a \"troubled heart\"; consumed by bitterness and anger, he deserts both his job and his family. Returning two years later at the news of his mother's terminal illness, Robert McEvoy arrives only to confront the grave diggers preparing her final resting place. His father, the mill's gardener, is now working on the factory line, the gardens forgotten. These proceedings stoke the slow burning rage McEvoy carries within him, a fury that ultimately consumes both the McEvoys and the Greggs.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd11b48685135a1ddc56.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29de5fb486852b17da19bf","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c0","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c1","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c2","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c3","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c4","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c5","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c6","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c7","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c8","5c29de5fb486852b17da19c9","5c29de5fb486852b17da19ca"],"year":"","zh_author":"麦卡锡","zh_bookname":"园丁的儿子——一部剧本"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["园丁的儿子——一部剧本"],"author":["Cormac McCarthy"],"zh_author":["麦卡锡"],"bookname":["The Gardener's Son- A Screenplay"]}}

For Wilfred Barclay, novelist, the final, unbearable irritation is Professor Rick. L. Tucker, implacable in his determination to become The Barclay Man. Locked in a lethal relationship they stumble half-blindly across Europe, shedding wives, self-respect, illusions. They confront terrifying abysses - physical, emotional, spiritual - and continually change roles, change themselves, change the worlds about them. The climax of their odyssey, when it comes, is as inevitable as it is unexpected. Powerful, unpredictable and unclassifiable, The Paper Men is as idiosyncratic and original as anything William Golding wrote.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde3b48685135a22db80.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.18,"goodreads_ratings":554,"level":2,"publisher":"Faber & Faber","segments":["5c29e766b486852b17de10f9","5c29e766b486852b17de10fa","5c29e766b486852b17de10fb","5c29e766b486852b17de10fc","5c29e766b486852b17de10fd","5c29e766b486852b17de10fe","5c29e766b486852b17de10ff","5c29e766b486852b17de1100","5c29e766b486852b17de1101","5c29e766b486852b17de1102","5c29e766b486852b17de1103","5c29e766b486852b17de1104","5c29e766b486852b17de1105","5c29e766b486852b17de1106","5c29e766b486852b17de1107","5c29e766b486852b17de1108"],"year":"1984","zh_author":"威廉戈尔丁","zh_bookname":"纸人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.18],"goodreads_ratings":[554],"year":["1984"],"zh_bookname":["纸人"],"author":["William Golding"],"zh_author":["威廉戈尔丁"],"bookname":["Paper Men"]}}

He takes in and leaves out according to his taste. He makes many a big thing small and small thing big. He has no compunction in putting into the background that which was to the fore, or bringing to the front that which was behind. In short he is painting pictures, and not writing history. Thus, over Life's outward aspect passes the series of events, and within is being painted a set of pictures. The two correspond but are not one. We do not get the leisure to view thoroughly this studio within us. Portions of it now and then catch our eye, but the greater part remains out of sight in the darkness. Why the ever-busy painter is painting; when he will have done; for what gallery his pictures are destined who can tell? Some years ago, on being questioned as to the events of my past life, I had occasion to pry into this picture-chamber. I had thought to be content with selecting some few materials for my Life's story. I then discovered, as I opened the door, that Life's memories are not Life's history, but the original work of an unseen Artist. The variegated colours scattered about are not reflections of outside lights, but belong to the painter himself, and come passion-tinged from his heart; thereby unfitting the record on the canvas for use as evidence in a court of law. But though the attempt to gather precise history from memory's storehouse may be fruitless, there is a fascination in looking over the pictures, a fascination which cast its spell on me. The road over which we journey, the wayside shelter in which we pause, are not pictures while yet we travel they are too necessary, too obvious. When, however, before turning into the evening resthouse, we look back upon the cities, fields, rivers and hills which we have been through in Life's morning, then, in the light of the passing day, are they pictures indeed. Thus, when my opportunity came, did I look back, and was engrossed.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de00b48685135a23ad5d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.17,"goodreads_ratings":226,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33a","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33b","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33c","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33d","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33e","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb33f","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb340","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb341","5c29e8f8b486852b17deb342"],"year":"","zh_author":"泰戈尔","zh_bookname":"我的回忆"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.17],"goodreads_ratings":[226],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["我的回忆"],"author":["Rabindranath Tagore"],"zh_author":["泰戈尔"],"bookname":["My Reminiscences"]}}

It is an epic saga of India s nationalist awakening, viewed through the eyes of one young man, an orthodox Hindu who defines himself against the British colonialist culture and finds himself approaching his nationalist identity through the prism of organized religion. First published in 1907, Gora questions the dogmas and presuppositions inherent in nationalist thought like few books have dared to do. This new, lucid and vibrant translation brings the complete and unabridged text of the classic to a new generation of readers, underlining its contemporary relevance.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de11b48685135a242fbd.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.21,"goodreads_ratings":2657,"level":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d4","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d5","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d6","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d7","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d8","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10d9","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10da","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10db","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10dc","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10dd","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10de","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10df","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e0","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e1","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e2","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e3","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e4","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e5","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e6","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e7","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e8","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10e9","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ea","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10eb","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ec","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ed","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ee","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ef","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f0","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f1","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f2","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f3","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f4","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f5","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f6","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f7","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f8","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10f9","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10fa","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10fb","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10fc","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10fd","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10fe","5c29e9cfb486852b17df10ff","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1100","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1101","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1102","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1103","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1104","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1105","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1106","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1107","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1108","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1109","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110a","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110b","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110c","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110d","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110e","5c29e9cfb486852b17df110f","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1110","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1111","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1112","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1113","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1114","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1115","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1116","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1117","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1118","5c29e9cfb486852b17df1119","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111a","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111b","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111c","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111d","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111e","5c29e9cfb486852b17df111f"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"泰戈尔","zh_bookname":"哥拉"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.21],"goodreads_ratings":[2657],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["哥拉"],"author":["Rabindranath Tagore"],"zh_author":["泰戈尔"],"bookname":["Gora"]}}

Controversial, even shocking, when it was written, the work continues to be so even today. The keen listener can hear why, because it poses fundamental questions about justice, the ownership and stewardship of the land, the role of government, power, and the very foundations of capitalist society. As history, this brings the Dust Bowl years to life in a most memorable way. Steinbeck (Travels with Charley, Audio Reviews, LJ 11/15/94) is a master storyteller and manages to engage the listener's sympathy with this epic story. Reader Dylan Baker, who gives each character a distinctive voice, draws the listener in. His female characters, especially the minor ones and Rose of Sharon, don't seem as authentic as his wonderful evocation of the fictional Tom, Ma, and Pa. But his voice is easy to listen to, and he is faithful to the characters' backgrounds and the plains region. The music that ends each individual tape is perfect for the story. This program is a well-produced, affordable, and worthwhile addition for any library with a serious audiobook collection.?Nancy Paul, Brandon P.L., WI Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc. Review Novel by John Steinbeck, published in 1939. Set during the Great Depression, it traces the migration of an Oklahoma Dust Bowl family to California and their subsequent hardships as migrant farm workers. It won a Pulitzer Prize in 1940. The work did much to publicize the injustices of migrant labor. The narrative, interrupted by prose-poem interludes, chronicles the struggles of the Joad family's life on a failing Oklahoma farm, their difficult journey to California, and their disillusionment once they arrive there and fall prey to a parasitic economic system. The insularity of the Joads--Ma's obsession with family togetherness, son Tom's self-centeredness, and daughter Rose of Sharon's materialism--ultimately gives way to a sense of universal community. -- The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd53b48685135a1fa6b2.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.94,"goodreads_ratings":604972,"level":3,"likeNum":1,"numberOfReading":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e1c1b486852b17db87e5","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87e6","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87e7","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87e8","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87e9","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87ea","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87eb","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87ec","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87ed","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87ee","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87ef","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f0","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f1","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f2","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f3","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f4","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f5","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f6","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f7","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f8","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87f9","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87fa","5c29e1c1b486852b17db87fb"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"愤怒的葡萄"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.94],"goodreads_ratings":[604972],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["愤怒的葡萄"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["The Grapes of Wrath"]}}

Unburdened by the material necessities of the more fortunate, the denizens of Cannery Row discover rewards unknown in more traditional society. Henry the painter sorts through junk lots for pieces of wood to incorporate into the boat he is building, while the girls from Dora Flood's bordello venture out now and then to enjoy a bit of sunshine. Lee Chong stocks his grocery with almost anything a man could want, and Doc, a young marine biologist who ministers to sick puppies and unhappy souls, unexpectedly finds true love. Cannery Row is just a few blocks long, but the story it harbors is suffused with warmth, understanding, and a great fund of human values. First published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual.

His brothers and their families share in Joseph's prosperity, and the farm flourishes - until one brother, frightened by Joseph's pagan belief, kills the tree, allowing disease and famine to descend on the farm.

Gao Xingjian was born on 4 January 1940 in war torn China soon after the beginning of the Japanese invasion. He completed secondary and tertiary studies in the People's Republic of China (established in 1949 after the Communist victory in the civil war against the Nationalists), graduating with a major in French from the Beijing Foreigh Languages Institute in 1962. Soul Mountain is a literary response to the devastation of the self of the individual by the primitive human urge for the warmth and security of an other, or others, in other words by socialized life. The existence of an other resolves the problem of lonelliness but brings with it anxieties for the individual, for inherent in any relationship is, inevitably, some form of power struggle.\" This is a very good book and quite interesting to read. The spine is tight and straight, the pages are free of markings. \"In 1983, Chinese playwright, critic, fiction writer, and painter, Gao Xingjian was diagnosed with lung cancer and faced imminment death. But six weeks later, a second examination revealed there was no cancer, he had won a reprieve from death. Faced with a repressive cultural environment and the threat of a spell in a prison farm, Gao fled Beijing and began a jorney 15,000 kilometers into the remote mountains and ancient forests of Sichuan in Southwest China.\" ** <div class=\"three columns ad","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd87b48685135a20b2ef.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.56,"goodreads_ratings":3711,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68aa","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ab","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ac","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ad","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ae","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68af","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b0","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b1","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b2","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b3","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b4","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b5","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b6","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b7","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b8","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68b9","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ba","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68bb","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68bc","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68bd","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68be","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68bf","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c0","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c1","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c2","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c3","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c4","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c5","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c6","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c7","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c8","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68c9","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ca","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68cb","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68cc","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68cd","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68ce","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68cf","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d0","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d1","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d2","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d3","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d4","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d5","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d6","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d7","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d8","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68d9","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68da","5c29e3aeb486852b17dc68db"],"year":"2000","zh_author":"高行健","zh_bookname":"灵魂山"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.56],"goodreads_ratings":[3711],"year":["2000"],"zh_bookname":["灵魂山"],"author":["Gao Xingjian"],"zh_author":["高行健"],"bookname":["Soul Mountain"]}}

The book's first story, for instance, jumps right off with a dazzlingly convincing narrative voice - that of a black Southern small-town woman - but interest soon sinks as the story's bland premise becomes clear: it's a fictionalized, sentimental little riff on Elvis Presley and the black blues writer-singer whose music helped make him famous (with unsubtle echoes of the familiar exploitation issue). Likewise, a vignette of an elderly black, much-feted writer - which is deliciously told but holds only the most obvious ironies. And most of the more intensely serious stories here appear to sacrifice texture of character and incident to sociological debate-and-discussion: reminiscences of black/white sex during the Civil Rights years; two contrasted black women's lives over the years; a monologue-anecdote about a black woman who kills her white lover/abuser; plus some unabashed propaganda re pornography (with special reference to the portrayal of black women in porn). When concentrating on love and marriage, however, Walker seems to ease off a bit and does some genuine exploring: \"The Lover\" - about a black woman having an affair with a charming, intellectually petty New York Jew at a writers' colony - is unformed but alive; \"Laurel\" verges on melodrama - a now-married black woman haunted by her mad, white-country-boy ex-lover - but has undeniable grab; and best of all is \"The Abortion,\" the painful anatomy of a deteriorating marriage. Ragged, often superficial work, then - with more sociological interest (the black/feminist intersection) than literary. ( Kirkus Reviews ) About the Author Best-selling novelist ALICE WALKER is the author of five other novels, five collections of short stories, six collections of essays, seven volumes of poetry, including the most recent Hard Times Require Furious Dancing, and several children s books.

Struck dumb with grief at her mother's death, it is down to her father, the heartbroken minister Tyler Caskey, to bring his daughter out of silence she has observed in the wake of the family's tragedy. But Tyler Caskey is barely surviving himself. His cold, church-assigned home is colder still since Lauren's death, and he struggles to find the right words for his sermons; struggles to be a leader to his congregation when he himself is lost. When Katherine's schoolteacher calls to discuss his daughter's anti-social behaviour, it sparks a chain of events that begins to tear down Tyler's defences. The small-town rumour-mill has much to make of Katherine's odd behaviour, and even more to say about Tyler's relationship with his housekeeper, Connie Hatch. And in Tyler's darkest hour, a startling discovery will test his congregation's humanity - and his own will to endure the kinds of trials that sooner or later test us all.

With\"pitch-perfect writing\" ( USA Today ), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time, March secures Geraldine Brookss place as a renowned author of historical fiction. From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Brooks's luminous second novel, after 2001's acclaimed Year of Wonders , imagines the Civil War experiences of Mr. March, the absent father in Louisa May Alcott's Little Women . An idealistic Concord cleric, March becomes a Union chaplain and later finds himself assigned to be a teacher on a cotton plantation that employs freed slaves, or \"contraband.\" His narrative begins with cheerful letters home, but March gradually reveals to the reader what he does not to his family: the cruelty and racism of Northern and Southern soldiers, the violence and suffering he is powerless to prevent and his reunion with Grace, a beautiful, educated slave whom he met years earlier as a Connecticut peddler to the plantations. In between, we learn of March's earlier life: his whirlwind courtship of quick-tempered Marmee, his friendship with Emerson and Thoreau and the surprising cause of his family's genteel poverty. When a Confederate attack on the contraband farm lands March in a Washington hospital, sick with fever and guilt, the first-person narrative switches to Marmee, who describes a different version of the years past and an agonized reaction to the truth she uncovers about her husband's life. Brooks, who based the character of March on Alcott's transcendentalist father, Bronson, relies heavily on primary sources for both the Concord and wartime scenes; her characters speak with a convincing 19th-century formality, yet the narrative is always accessible. Through the shattered dreamer March, the passion and rage of Marmee and a host of achingly human minor characters, Brooks's affecting, beautifully written novel drives home the intimate horrors and ironies of the Civil War and the difficulty of living honestly with the knowledge of human suffering. Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From School Library Journal Adult/High School-In Brooks's well-researched interpretation of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women , Mr. March also remains a shadowy figure for the girls who wait patiently for his letters. They keep a stiff upper lip, answering his stiff, evasive, flowery letters with cheering accounts of the plays they perform and the charity they provide, hiding their own civilian privations. Readers, however, are treated to the real March, based loosely upon the character of Alcott's own father. March is a clergyman influenced by Thoreau, Emerson, and especially John Brown (to whom he loses a fortune). His high-minded ideals are continually thwarted not only by the culture of the times, but by his own ineptitude as well. A staunch abolitionist, he is amazingly naive about human nature. He joins the Union army and soon becomes attached to a hospital unit. His radical politics are an embarrassment to the less ideological men, and he is appalled by their lack of abolitionist sentiments and their cruelty. When it appears that he has committed a sexual indiscretion with a nurse, a former slave and an old acquaintance, March is sent to a plantation where the recently freed slaves earn wages but continue to experience cruelty and indignities. Here his faith in himself and in his religious and political convictions are tested. Sick and discouraged, he returns to his little women, who have grown strong in his absence. March, on the other hand, has experienced the horrors of war, serious illness, guilt, regret, and utter disillusionment. -Jackie Gropman, Chantilly Regional Library, VA Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Nobel Prize-winning writer narrates the unabridged version of the book in a rich, soothing voice that mesmerizes listeners with its relaxed and methodical cadence. Sula revolves around the relationship between two little girls growing up in a poor, black neighborhood nestled high in the hilltops. \"The Bottom,\" as the barrio came to be known, is brimming with eccentric residents but sadly deprived of human warmth. (The town actually takes pride in celebrating National Suicide Day.) However, out of this bitter, abrasive environment grows a beautiful friendship between Sula and Nel. Their shared secrets and dreams blossom through childhood, but their special bond suffers after the two separate. Sula leaves the Bottom to conquer the unknown cities of America, while Nel becomes a homebody, settling down as a wife and mother. When Sula returns to her hometown, she feels like a stranger; she repels everyone, even the only true friend she ever knew. Morrison's vocal range evokes an extraordinary atmosphere of survival in a harsh and unforgiving world. (Four cassettes; running time: aprox. four hours) From Library Journal Hearing an author read her own work creates a special ambiance. To hear Morrison read a short, unabridged novel published 24 years ago, to hear in her voice how much she still values the writing, well, who could ask for more?

In this earlier collection, she demonstrates all of those strengths that have won her so many literary accolades. A divorced woman returns to her childhood home where she confronts the memory of her parents' confounding yet deep bond. The accidental near-drowning of a child exposes the fragility of the trust between children and parents. A young man, remembering a terrifying childhood incident, wrestles with the responsibility he has always felt for his younger brother. In these and other stories Alice Munro proves once again a sensitive and compassionate chronicler of our times. Drawing us into the most intimate corners of ordinary lives, she reveals much about ourselves, our choices, and our experiences of love. From the Trade Paperback edition.

The woman is Marie Kuraki, recruited to act the part of a \"sorrowing mother,\" to help unite the workers on a cooperative farm in a remote village in Mexico. By becoming a \"saint,\" Marie, an unbeliever in search of spiritual peace, reaches the end of a long journey induced by a series of personal tragedies: above all, by the death of her two sons, which happened when one of them was pushing his brother in a wheelchair along a path above a cliff by the sea. To rebuild her life, Marie leaves her home in Japan to go to a commune in California, under the shy guidance of a guru called Little Father; then on to Mexico, where she falls briefly under the spell of the Dark Virgin of Guadalupe; and finally to a mountain village in the shadow of an Aztec pyramid. There she offers what's left of her life to the local people, who come to venerate her, though her own faith remains as enigmatic as before.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd78b48685135a20498f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.5,"goodreads_ratings":153,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e2e9b486852b17dc116d","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc116e","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc116f","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1170","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1171","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1172","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1173","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1174","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1175","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1176","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1181","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118c","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1197","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1199","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119a","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119b","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119c","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119d","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119e","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc119f","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a0","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a1","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a2","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a3","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a4","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a5","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a6","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a7","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a8","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11a9","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11aa","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ab","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ac","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ad","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ae","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11af","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b0","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b1","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b2","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b3","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b4","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b5","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b6","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b7","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b8","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11b9","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ba","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11bb","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11bc","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11bd","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11be","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11bf","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c0","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c1","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c2","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c3","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c4","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c5","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c6","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c7","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c8","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11c9","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ca","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11cb","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11cc","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11cd","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ce","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11cf","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d0","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d1","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d2","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d3","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d4","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d5","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d6","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d7","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d8","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11d9","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11da","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11db","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11dc","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11dd","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11de","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11df","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e0","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e1","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e2","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e3","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e4","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e5","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e6","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e7","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e8","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11e9","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ea","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11eb","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ec","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ed","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc11ee","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1177","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1178","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1179","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117a","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117b","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117c","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117d","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117e","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc117f","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1180","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1182","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1183","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1184","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1185","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1186","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1187","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1188","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1189","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118a","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118b","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118d","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118e","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc118f","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1190","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1191","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1192","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1193","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1194","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1195","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1196","5c29e2e9b486852b17dc1198"],"year":"","zh_author":"大江健三郎","zh_bookname":"天堂的回声"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.5],"goodreads_ratings":[153],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["天堂的回声"],"author":["Kenzaburo Oe"],"zh_author":["大江健三郎"],"bookname":["An Echo of Heaven"]}}

She combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humourous and incisive novels and short stories. Wharton was well-acquainted with many of her era's literary and public figures, including Henry James and Theodore Roosevelt. Besides her writing, she was a highly regarded landscape architect, interior designer, and taste-maker of her time. She wrote several influential books, including The Decoration of Houses (1897), her first published work, and Italian Villas and Their Gardens (1904). The Age of Innocence (1920), perhaps her best known work, won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for literature, making her the first woman to win the award. Her other works include: The Greater Inclination (1899), The Touchstone (1900), Sanctuary (1903), The Descent of Man and Other Stories (1904), The House of Mirth (1905), Madame de Treymes (1907), The Fruit of the Tree (1907), The Hermit and the Wild Woman and Other Stories (1908), Ethan Frome (1912), In Morocco (1921), and The Glimpses of the Moon (1921).","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd51b48685135a1f9248.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.38,"goodreads_ratings":13,"level":4,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e197b486852b17db775b","5c29e197b486852b17db775c","5c29e197b486852b17db775d","5c29e197b486852b17db775e","5c29e197b486852b17db775f","5c29e197b486852b17db7760","5c29e197b486852b17db7761","5c29e197b486852b17db7762","5c29e197b486852b17db7763","5c29e197b486852b17db7764","5c29e197b486852b17db7765","5c29e197b486852b17db7766","5c29e197b486852b17db7767","5c29e197b486852b17db7768","5c29e197b486852b17db7769","5c29e197b486852b17db776a","5c29e197b486852b17db776b","5c29e197b486852b17db776c","5c29e197b486852b17db776d","5c29e197b486852b17db776e","5c29e197b486852b17db776f","5c29e197b486852b17db7770","5c29e197b486852b17db7771","5c29e197b486852b17db7772","5c29e197b486852b17db7773"],"year":"","zh_author":"伊迪丝沃顿","zh_bookname":"阿特米斯到阿克泰翁和其他诗句"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.38],"goodreads_ratings":[13],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["阿特米斯到阿克泰翁和其他诗句"],"author":["Edith Wharton"],"zh_author":["伊迪丝沃顿"],"bookname":["Artemis To Actaeon And Other Verse"]}}

In a masterpiece of brevity, Wharton dramatizes the contrast between the two opposing forces: the simple and proper old brownstone New York, low in style but high in principle, and the achingly beautiful but decadent Saint-Germain district of Paris.

After divorce, Mrs Lidcote went into voluntary exile in Europe. She returns to NY, anxious about the wedding of her divorced daughter, Leila. The mother doesn t know her place in the new order: her daughter is not shamed, so doesn t need support. Worse, a shabby mother is an embarrassment in Leila s elevated social circles. Mrs Lidcote begins to resent her own lost years, and wonder if it s too late. Two people appear sympathetic to her predicaments: one tells tactful untruths to veil painful reality; the other is selfishly, subtly manipulative, using duplicity disguised as concern. * The past was bad enough, but the present and future were worse, because they were less comprehensible. * Having so signally failed to be of use to Leila in other ways, she would at least serve her as a warning. * Their relation seemed as comfortable as their furniture and as respectable as their balance at the bank. More Wharton Stories I read this as one of twenty stories in The New York Stories of Edith Wharton , which I reviewed here .

As the collective title indicates, the themes here are political; yet, frankly, it is doubtful how seriously we can now take Shaw as a political thinker. Despite writing in the 1930s, he has little to say of the nature of totalitarianism: although he satirises Fascist dictators in ''Geneva'', the satire is disappointingly mild. Neither did Shaw appear to foresee (on the evidence of these plays, at least) the imminent collapse of the British Empire.But it is Shaw the dramatist rather than Shaw the political philosopher who still holds our attention -- even in plays as explicitly political as these. He had a sharp intellect and a quirky sense of humour, and his dialogue still glints and sparkles: he couldn't write a dull line if he tried. No matter how serious the themes he addresses, the crispness of his writing and his lightness of touch still...","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddffb48685135a23a66a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.68,"goodreads_ratings":4552,"level":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc4","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc5","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc6","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc7","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc8","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadc9","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadca","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadcb","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadcc","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadcd","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadce","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadcf","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd0","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd1","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd2","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd3","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd4","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd5","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd6","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd7","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd8","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadd9","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadda","5c29e8ebb486852b17deaddb","5c29e8ebb486852b17deaddc","5c29e8ebb486852b17deaddd","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadde","5c29e8ebb486852b17deaddf","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade0","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade1","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade2","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade3","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade4","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade5","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade6","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade7","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade8","5c29e8ebb486852b17deade9","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadea","5c29e8ebb486852b17deadeb"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"萧伯纳","zh_bookname":"玩政治（苹果车；在岩石区上；日内瓦）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.68],"goodreads_ratings":[4552],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["玩政治（苹果车；在岩石区上；日内瓦）"],"author":["George Bernard Shaw"],"zh_author":["萧伯纳"],"bookname":["Plays Political (The Apple Cart; On the Rocks; Geneva)"]}}

Ranging over three generations--and clustered mainly in two clans, the Grouses and the Gaffneys--these remarkably various lives share only the common human dilemmas and the awesome physical and emotional presence of Mohawk itself. For this is a town like Winesburg, Ohio or Our Town , in our time, that encompasses a plethora of characters, events and mysteries. At once honestly tragic and sharply, genuinely funny, Mohawk captures life, then affirms it.

When he is discovered to be an exceptionally gifted student, the entire community presses him onto a path of serious scholarship.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Largely overshadowed by Orson Welles s famous 1941 screen version, Booth Tarkington s novel The Magnificent Ambersons was not only a best-seller when it first appeared in 1918 it also won the Pulitzer Prize.Set in the Midwest in the early twentieth century the dawn of the automobile age the novel begins by introducing the richest family in town, the Ambersons. Exemplifying aristocratic excess, the Ambersons have everything money can buy and more. But George Amberson Minafer the spoiled grandson of the family patriarch is unable to see that great societal changes are taking place, and that business tycoons, industrialists, and real estate developers will soon surpass him in wealth and prestige. Rather than join the new mechanical age, George prefers to remain a gentleman, believing that being things is superior to doing things. But as his town becomes a city, and the family palace is enveloped in a cloud of soot, George s protectors disappear one by one, and the elegant, cloistered lifestyle of the Ambersons fades from view, and finally vanishes altogether.A brilliant portrayal of the changing landscape of the American dream, The Magnificent Ambersons is a timeless classic that deserves a wider modern audience.

Mr. and Mrs. Adams and their two children are members of the lower middle-class. Their daughter, Alice, wrestles with this economic classification and attempts to make the society folk of the town appreciate her. Because Alice has no social influence nor wealth and her presence is held in disregard by prospective suitors, Mrs. Adams tries to improve the situation by persuading her husband to leave a job he's held all his life and to establish a new career. After much apprehension and in possession of a glue formula stolen from his previous employer, he resigns his mediocre but satisfying employment which puts him in a predicament that leads to his professional downfall. Tarkington's understanding of class rivalries, social condescension, and financial avarice is evident in this tale where his main point indicates that in every joyless moment hope, though unexpected, is attainable. He illustrates how the Adams' laborious efforts are ultimately unsuccessful. Any intrusion by Alice and her mother on the upper class is unlikely and Tarkington's depiction of such is secretly amusing.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dde1b48685135a22cb23.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.63,"goodreads_ratings":3657,"level":2,"publisher":"NuVision Publications","segments":["5c29e74fb486852b17de03e2","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e3","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e4","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e5","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e6","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e7","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e8","5c29e74fb486852b17de03e9","5c29e74fb486852b17de03ea","5c29e74fb486852b17de03eb","5c29e74fb486852b17de03ec","5c29e74fb486852b17de03ed","5c29e74fb486852b17de03ee","5c29e74fb486852b17de03ef","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f0","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f1","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f2","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f3","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f4","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f5","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f6","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f7","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f8","5c29e74fb486852b17de03f9","5c29e74fb486852b17de03fa"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"布思 塔金顿","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"爱丽丝亚当斯"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.63],"goodreads_ratings":[3657],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["爱丽丝亚当斯"],"author":["Booth Tarkington"],"zh_author":["布思 塔金顿"],"bookname":["Alice Adams"]}}

The seventy-nine-year-old painter Hope Chafetz, who in the course of her eventful life has been Hope Ouderkirk, Hope McCoy, and Hope Holloway, answers questions put to her by a New York interviewer named Kathryn, and recapitulates, through stories from her career and many marriages, the triumphant, poignant saga of postwar American art. In the evolving relation between the two women, interviewer and subject move in and out of the roles of daughter and mother, therapist and patient, predator and prey, supplicant and idol.

Ford Administration (1974--77), he recalls not the political events of the time but rather a turbulent period of his own sexual past. Alf's highly idiosyncratic contribution to Retrospect consists not only of reams of unbuttoned personal history but also of pages from an unpublished project of the time, a chronicle of the presidency of James Buchanan (1857--61). The alternating texts mirror each other and tell a story in counterpoint, a frequently hilarious comedy of manners contrasting the erotic etiquette and social dictions of antebellum Washington with those of late-twentieth-century southern New Hampshire.

Worth, a thoroughly modern spiritual seeker who has become enamored of a Hindu mystic called the Arhat. A native New Englander, she goes west to join his ashram in Arizona, and there struggles alongside fellow sannyasins (pilgrims) in the difficult attempt to subdue ego and achieve moksha (salvation, release from illusion). ''S.'' details her adventures in letters and tapes dispatched to her husband, her daughter, her brother, her dentist, her hairdresser, and her psychiatrist--messages cleverly designed to keep her old world in order while she is creating for herself a new one. This is Hester Prynne's side of the triangle described by Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter; it is also a burlesque of the quest for enlightenment, and an affectionate meditation on American womanhood.

All of these stories, each in its own way, partake of this glow, as life beyond middle age is explored and found to have its own exquisite dearness. As death approaches, existence takes on, for some of Updike s aging characters, a translucence, a magical fragility; vivid memory and casual misperception lend the mundane an antic texture, and the backward view, lengthening, acquires a certain grandeur. Here is a world where wonder stubbornly persists, and fresh beginnings almost outnumber losses.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddf6b48685135a23629f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Random House Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e85ab486852b17de78fb","5c29e85ab486852b17de78fc","5c29e85ab486852b17de78fd","5c29e85ab486852b17de78fe","5c29e85ab486852b17de78ff","5c29e85ab486852b17de7900","5c29e85ab486852b17de7901","5c29e85ab486852b17de7902"],"year":"2012","zh_author":"约翰 厄普代克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"来世"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2012"],"zh_bookname":["来世"],"author":["John Updike"],"zh_author":["约翰 厄普代克"],"bookname":["The Afterlife"]}}

That time frame accounts for most of the short fiction, published and unpublished, that followed the major collection issued in 1938, The First Forty-Nine. There are 60 stories in all. Of the 21 not included in the 1938 collection, the seven heretofore unpublished pieces will interest readers most. Three are especially good. \"A Train Trip\" and \"The Porter\" are self-contained excerpts from an abandoned novel that match in tone and appeal the early Hemingway work in which he explored the adolescent sensibility exposed to an adult world that is exciting but at the same time threatening and morally complex. Drawing from the author's experiences in Europe during World War II, \"Black Ass at the Crossroads\" is excellent in its detailing of violent action, portraying an ambush of German soldiers from the point of view of an American infantry officer, depressed and angry over the suffering he has inflicted in the course of battle. The other previously unpublished pieces include a Spanish Civil War story reminiscent of Hemingway's play, The Fifth Column; two quite touching stories about a father's disappointments with a troubled son; and a long section comprising four chapters from an early version of the novel, Islands in the Stream. Intrinsically readable, the collection is also significant in drawing together much that was unavailable or difficult to access. Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal A thoughtfully arranged, comprehensive edition of Hemingway's short fiction justifies publication. This is not it. At best, it offers convenience rather than creativity or even completeness: it omits five stories published two years ago. It reprints the \"the first 49\" stories (1938), adds 14 subsequently published, and appends seven hitherto unpublished. What is lacking is a fresh reordering of the storiesthematic, chronological, or stylistic. Further, three of the unpublished pieces are not stories but excerpts from novels. None of the new material is artistically significant. Yet each bears the hallmark of Hemingway's geniuswhich will survive even this.

Hemingway s frank portrayal of the love between Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkley, caught in the inexorable sweep of war, glows with an intensity unrivaled in modern literature, while his description of the German attack on Caporetto of lines of fired men marching in the rain, hungry, weary, and demoralized is one of the greatest moments in literary history. A story of love and pain, of loyalty and desertion, A Farewell to Arms, written when he was thirty years old, represents a new romanticism for Hemingway. Amazon.com Review As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with A Farewell to Arms . This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits: I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know. The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he \"did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards.\" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine. Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and A Farewell to Arms , like his other novels ( For Whom the Bell Tolls , The Sun Also Rises , and To Have and Have Not ), offers neither. What it does provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. --Alix Wilber From Library Journal These dual Hemingways are the latest volumes in the Scribner Paperback Fiction series (Classic Returns, February 15, p. 187).

It is the story of two young Clevelanders, Jonathan and Bobby, who become boyhood friends in spite of, and partly because of, their unhappily adjusted parents. They eventually emigrate to New York, where they end up living together--and with a superbly realized eccentric, Clare, a very hip but desperate woman who tries to relate to them both, ends up having Bobby's child, attempts to share life in the country with them and eventually drifts away. Other characters rendered in detail include Jonathan's mother, Alice, a firm-minded survivor; her ever-optimistic husband, Ned; and Jonathan's sometime lover Erich, who comes to agonizing life for the reader only as he is dying of AIDS. No praise can be too high for Cunningham's writing. He worked six years on the novel, and it shows in the careful way he evokes fleeting thoughts and states of consciousness, in the lyrical sense of the ordinariness of place, whether Cleveland, New York, Arizona or upstate New York, in the musical background that accompanies much of the action, almost as in a movie, and in the unexpected ways that characters who have not met before interrelate when they do. His story is told from several alternating points of view--Jonathan's, Bobby's, Clare's and Alice's--and though this works well in narrative terms, the voices are not as different as one would expect from such fully realized characters. And some scenes, like the birth of Clare's baby, are unaccountably missing. Still, this is a gripping, haunting piece of work from a writer of real promise and power. 35,000 forst printing; $50,000 ad/promo; BOMC and QPB selections; movie rights to Sinecom. Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal Cunningham's novel focuses on the close friendship of Bobby and Jonathan. As boyhood friends growing up in Cleveland in the late Sixties and Seventies, Bobby and Jonathan form a relationship that is both average and far beyond what most kids would consider ''normal.'' After high school Jonathan moves to New York City, where Bobby soon follows. They become involved with Clare, a slightly older woman who finds each one appealing in his own way. The rest of the novel centers on their unusual life together. This well-written book has lots of good dialog and will appeal to readers who want something other than the tried and true best seller. - Mary K. Prokop, CEL Regional Lib., Savannah, Ga.

The Hamlet, the first book of the series chronicling the advent and rise of the grasping Snopes family in mythical Yoknapatawpha County, in a work that Cleanth Brooks called ''one of the richest novels in the Faulkner canon.'' It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes uses an exploiter's mentality to dominate the rural community of Frenchman's Bend--and claim the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. The Town, the second novel, records Flem's ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi. The book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and profundity and explores love, both sacred and profane. Finally, The Mansion tells of Mink Snopes, whose archaic sense of honor brings about the downfall of his cousin Flem. ''For all his concern with the South, Faulkner was actually seeking out the nature of man,'' noted Ralph Ellison. ''Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics.'' This volume includes a new introduction to the trilogy by acclaimed novelist George Garrett, author of Death of the Fox and The Succession.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3ab48685135a1ef5e1.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.37,"goodreads_ratings":645,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e07cb486852b17dafefb","5c29e07cb486852b17dafefc","5c29e07cb486852b17dafefd","5c29e07cb486852b17dafefe","5c29e07cb486852b17dafeff","5c29e07cb486852b17daff00","5c29e07cb486852b17daff01","5c29e07cb486852b17daff02","5c29e07cb486852b17daff03","5c29e07cb486852b17daff04","5c29e07cb486852b17daff05","5c29e07cb486852b17daff06","5c29e07cb486852b17daff07","5c29e07cb486852b17daff08","5c29e07cb486852b17daff09","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0a","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0b","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0c","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0d","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0e","5c29e07cb486852b17daff0f","5c29e07cb486852b17daff10","5c29e07cb486852b17daff11","5c29e07cb486852b17daff12","5c29e07cb486852b17daff13","5c29e07cb486852b17daff14","5c29e07cb486852b17daff15","5c29e07cb486852b17daff16","5c29e07cb486852b17daff17","5c29e07cb486852b17daff18","5c29e07cb486852b17daff19","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1a","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1b","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1c","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1d","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1e","5c29e07cb486852b17daff1f","5c29e07cb486852b17daff20","5c29e07cb486852b17daff21","5c29e07cb486852b17daff22","5c29e07cb486852b17daff23","5c29e07cb486852b17daff24","5c29e07cb486852b17daff25","5c29e07cb486852b17daff26","5c29e07cb486852b17daff27","5c29e07cb486852b17daff28","5c29e07cb486852b17daff29","5c29e07cb486852b17daff2a","5c29e07cb486852b17daff2b","5c29e07cb486852b17daff2c"],"year":"2011","zh_author":"威廉福克纳","zh_bookname":"哈姆雷特，小镇，豪宅"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.37],"goodreads_ratings":[645],"year":["2011"],"zh_bookname":["哈姆雷特，小镇，豪宅"],"author":["William Faulkner"],"zh_author":["威廉福克纳"],"bookname":["The Hamlet, The Town, The Mansion"]}}

Spotted Horses is a hilarious account of a horse auction, and pits the cold practicality of women against the boyish folly of men. Old Man is something of an adventure story. When a flood ravages the countryside of the lower Mississippi, a convict finds himself adrift with a pregnant woman. And The Bear , perhaps his best known shorter work, is the story of a boy's coming to terms wit the adult world. By learning how to hunt, the boy is taught the real meaning of pride, humility, and courage.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddb5b48685135a2219bc.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.87,"goodreads_ratings":1547,"level":3,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e62ab486852b17dd77d9","5c29e62ab486852b17dd77da","5c29e62ab486852b17dd77db","5c29e62ab486852b17dd77dc","5c29e62ab486852b17dd77dd"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"威廉福克纳","zh_bookname":"三部著名短篇小说（斑点马；老人；熊）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.87],"goodreads_ratings":[1547],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["三部著名短篇小说（斑点马；老人；熊）"],"author":["William Faulkner"],"zh_author":["威廉福克纳"],"bookname":["Three Famous Short Novels (Spotted Horses; Old Man; The Bear)"]}}

This new collection includes twenty-two stories now appearing in English for the first time in book form. Written between 1923 and 1929, these short fictions form a shadow biography of the author's early years, and provide fresh glimpses of Kawabata's haunting and haunted vision. Born in 1899, Kawabata committed suicide at age seventy-two. Throughout his life he was concerned with themes of loss, longing, and memory. His childhood was repeatedly shaken by deaths in the family - first his parents when he was three, then a grandmother, an older sister, and finally the blind grandfather he cared for in his early adolescence. These personal losses linger as motifs in such remarkable stories as \"Gathering Ashes\" and \"The Master of Funerals.\" The stark physical details of caregiving - suffused with edgy resentment and desperate fear - are remembered in \"Diary of My Sixteenth Year.\" In addition to the twenty-two stories unknown to American readers, this collection features the first translation of the complete text of the classic \"Dancing Girl of Izu.\" This unforgettable story portrays the tender anxiety of a young man whose brooding fascination with a pubescent girl nudges him along the path toward adulthood.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddaab48685135a21bf7f.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.79,"goodreads_ratings":1893,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dc5","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dc6","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dc7","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dc8","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dc9","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dca","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dcb","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dcc","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dcd","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dce","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dcf","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dd0","5c29e58ab486852b17dd2dd1"],"year":"1997","zh_author":"川端康成","zh_bookname":"伊豆舞女及其他故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.79],"goodreads_ratings":[1893],"year":["1997"],"zh_bookname":["伊豆舞女及其他故事"],"author":["Yasunari Kawabata"],"zh_author":["川端康成"],"bookname":["The Dancing Girl of Izu and Other Stories"]}}

A Nobel Prize winner who has been called the Garc a M rquez of Portugal ( New Statesman ) chronicles world events on a human scale in this exhilarating allegorical novel. One day, quite inexplicably, the Iberian Peninsula simply breaks free from the European continent and begins to drift as if it were a sort of stone raft. Panic ensues as residents and tourists attempt to escape, while crowds gather on cliffs to watch the newly formed island sail off into the sea. Meanwhile, five people on the island are drawn together first by a string of surreal events and then by love. Taking to the road to explore the limits of their now finite land, they find themselves adrift in a world made new by this radical shift in perspective. As bureaucrats ponder what to do about their unusual predicament, the intertwined lives of these five strangers are clarified and forever changed by a physical, spiritual, and sexual voyage to an unknown destination. At once an epic adventure and a profound fable about the state of the European project, The Stone Raft is a hauntingly lyrical narrative with political, social, and moral underpinnings ( Booklist ) that may be Saramago s finest work ( Los Angeles Times ).

On one such trip, he is told not to make any more deliveries. Unwilling to give up his craft, Cipriano tries his hand at making ceramic dolls. Astonishingly, The Center places an order for hundreds, and Cipriano and Marta set to work-until the order is cancelled and the three have to move from the village into The Center. When mysterious sounds of digging emerge from beneath their apartment, Cipriano and Mar?al investigate, and what they find transforms the family's life. Filled with the depth, humor, and the extraordinary philosophical richness that marks each of Saramago's novels, The Cave is one of the essential books of our time. Amazon.com Review Jos? Saramago is a master at pacing. Readers unfamiliar with the work of this Portuguese Nobel Prize winner would do well to begin with The Cave , a novel of ideas, shaded with suspense. Spare and pensive, The Cave follows the fortunes of an aging potter, Cipriano Algor, beginning with his weekly delivery of plates to the Center, a high-walled, windowless shopping complex, residential community, and nerve center that dominates the region. What sells at the Center will sell everywhere else, and what the Center rejects can barely be given away in the surrounding towns and villages. The news for Cipriano that morning isn't good. Half of his regular pottery shipment is rejected, and he is told that the consumers now prefer plastic tableware. Over the next week, he and his grown daughter Marta grieve for their lost craft, but they gradually open their eyes to the strange bounty of their new condition: a stray dog adopts them, and a lovely widow enters Cipriano's life. When they are invited to live at the Center, it seems ungracious to refuse, but there are strange developments under the complex and a troubling increase in security, and Cipriano changes all their fates by deciding to investigate. In Saramago's able hands, what might have become a dry social allegory is a delicately elaborated story of individualism and unexpected love. --Regina Marler From Publishers Weekly The struggle of the individual against bureaucracy and anonymity is one of the great subjects of modern literature, and Saramago is often matched with Kafka as one of its premier exponents. Apt as the comparison is, it doesn't convey the warmth and rueful human dimension of novels like Blindness and All the Names. Those qualities are particularly evident in his latest brilliant, dark allegory, which links the encroaching sterility of modern life to the parable of Plato's cave. Widowed Cipriano Algor is a 64-year-old Portuguese potter who finds his business collapsing when the demand dries up for his elegant, handcrafted wares. His potential fate seems worse than poverty-to move with his daughter, Marta, and his son-in-law, Mar al Gacho, into a huge, arid complex known as \"The Center,\" where Gacho works as a security guard. But Algor gets an order from the Center for hundreds of small ceramic figurines, a task that has Marta and Algor hustling to meet the delivery date. Saramago's flowing, luminous prose (beautifully translated by Costa) serves him well in the early going as he portrays the intricacies of Algor's artistic life and the beginning of his friendship with a widow he meets at the cemetery. The middle chapters bog down as the author lingers over the process of creating the dolls and the family's ongoing debate over Algor's future. But Saramago makes up for the brief slow stretch with a stunning ending after the doll project crashes, when Algor becomes a resident of the Center and finds a shocking surprise in a cave unearthed beneath it. The characters are as finely crafted as Algor's pottery, and Saramago deserves special kudos for his one-dog canine chorus, a stray mutt named Found that Algor adopts as his emotional sounding board. Saramago has an extraordinary ability to make a complex narrative read like a simple parable. This remarkably generous and eloquent novel is another landmark work from an 80-year-old literary giant who remains at the height of his powers.

His idea of the Holy Family reflects the real complexities of any family, and as only Saramago can he imagines them with tinges of vision, dream, and omen.

Originally published in 1939, Happy Valley is set in a small country town in the Snowy Mountains. Based on Patrick White s own experiences in the early 1930s as a jackaroo at Bolaro, near Adaminaby in south-eastern New South Wales, Happy Valley paints a portrait of a community in a desolate landscape. It is a jagged and restless study of small-town and country life. White was twenty-seven when Happy Valley was published by George C. Harrop in London.

Smiley ( A Thousand Acres ) goes Hollywood in this scintillating tale of an extended Decameron -esque L.A. house party. Gathering at the home of washed-up director Max the morning after the 2003 Academy Awards are his Iraq-obsessed girlfriend, Elena; his movie-diva ex-wife Zoe and her yoga instructor cum therapist cum boyfriend Paul; Max's insufferably PC daughter, Isabel, and his feckless agent, Stoney, who are conducting a secret affair; Zoe's oracular mother, Delphine; and Max's boyhood friend and token Republican irritant Charlie. They watch movies, negotiate their clashing diets and health regimens, indulge in a roundelay of lasciviously detailed sexual encounters and, most of all, talk holding absurd, meandering, beguiling conversation about movies, Hollywood, relationships, the war and the state of the world. Through it all, they compulsively reimagine daily life as art: Max dreams of making My Lovemaking with Elena , an all-nude, sexually explicit indie talk-fest inspired by My Dinner with Andre , but Stoney wants him to remake the Cossack epic Taras Bulba . Smiley delivers a delightful, subtly observant sendup of Tinseltown folly, yet she treats her characters, their concern with compelling surfaces and their perpetual quest to capture reality through artifice, with warmth and seriousness. In their shallowness, she finds a kind of profundity. (Feb.) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From Bookmarks Magazine Jane Smiley, who won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for A Thousand Acres , has written on a range of topics: horses, midwestern university life, real estate, Greenland, and, most recently, literature ( 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel , 1/2 Jan/Feb 2006). Ten Days , a social satire, tackles the superficial lives of Hollywood denizens to mixed acclaim. Many reviewers were sufficiently entertained by watching Smiley's set of spoiled, if smart, individuals interact and ruminate on their self-involved concerns; others found the conversations hackneyed. While Smiley's use of the Iraq war created some enlightened discussion, it also seemed like a heavy-handed device.

Mariana Musin is a vibrant young woman of restive emotions who has run out on her family in the South with romantic ambitions to be an opera singer, though her singing instructor advises her that she does not quite have the talent. Anthony Algarcife is a struggling scientist, raised by a priest, who has long kept his emotions in check to his intellect, until he falls for Mariana. The romance is quick, the marriage unsuccessful. They eventually separate, and as the story skips ahead eight years we discover that they have each taken a different, seemingly successful course in life, though in reality they have both suffered 'the slow torture of famished asperations'. Phases of an Inferior Planet , portentous title and all, is very similar to the works of two of Glasgow's contemporaries, Edith Wharton and Henry James, though not quite as sharp as Wharton, nor as flaccid as James. As with those two the occasional, direct intervention from the author themselves is often telling, as with this example: 'our conceptions of others are colored solely by their attitudes towards ourselves, and not in the least by their attitudes towards the universe, which, when all is said, is of far less consequence.' I always come away from novels of this period extremely thankful that lovers today have no such compulsions to turn a fleeting passion into an immediate matrimony.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1ab48685135a1e0bb4.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.57,"goodreads_ratings":7,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29debcb486852b17da3f50","5c29debcb486852b17da3f51","5c29debcb486852b17da3f52","5c29debcb486852b17da3f53","5c29debcb486852b17da3f54","5c29debcb486852b17da3f55","5c29debcb486852b17da3f56","5c29debcb486852b17da3f57","5c29debcb486852b17da3f58","5c29debcb486852b17da3f59","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5a","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5b","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5c","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5d","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5e","5c29debcb486852b17da3f5f","5c29debcb486852b17da3f60","5c29debcb486852b17da3f61","5c29debcb486852b17da3f62","5c29debcb486852b17da3f63","5c29debcb486852b17da3f64","5c29debcb486852b17da3f65","5c29debcb486852b17da3f66","5c29debcb486852b17da3f67","5c29debcb486852b17da3f68","5c29debcb486852b17da3f69","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6a","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6b","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6c","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6d","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6e","5c29debcb486852b17da3f6f","5c29debcb486852b17da3f70","5c29debcb486852b17da3f71","5c29debcb486852b17da3f72"],"year":"","zh_author":"格拉斯哥","zh_bookname":"下行星的相位"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.57],"goodreads_ratings":[7],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["下行星的相位"],"author":["Ellen Glasgow"],"zh_author":["格拉斯哥"],"bookname":["Phases of an Inferior Planet"]}}

Ranging from early, exhilarating celebrations of British expansion overseas, including \"Mandalay\" and \"Gunga Din\", to the dignified and inspirational \"If -\" and the later, deeply moving \"Epitaphs of the War\" - inspired by the death of Kipling's only son - it clearly illustrates the scope and originality of his work. It also offers a compelling insight into the Empire both at its peak and during its decline in the early years of the twentieth century.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd69b48685135a2002b0.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"Penguin Books Ltd","segments":["5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3f5","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3f6","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3f7","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3f8","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3f9","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3fa","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3fb","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3fc","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3fd","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3fe","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd3ff","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd400","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd401","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd402","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd403","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd404","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd405","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd406","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd407","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd408","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd409","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40a","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40b","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40c","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40d","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40e","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd40f","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd410","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd411","5c29e25cb486852b17dbd412"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"诗选（艾德Peter Keating）"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["诗选（艾德Peter Keating）"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["Selected Poems (ed Peter Keating)"]}}

Written when he was only 22 years old, the tale also features some of Rudyard Kipling s most crystalline prose, and one of the most beautifully rendered, spectacularly exotic settings he ever used. Best of all, it features two of his most unforgettable characters, the ultra-vivid Cockneys Peachy Carnahan and Daniel Dravot, who impart to the story its ultimate, astonishing twist: it is both a tragedy and a triumph. The Art of The Novella Series Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddecb48685135a23250a.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.72,"goodreads_ratings":9395,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e7f1b486852b17de4e42"],"year":"","zh_author":"吉卜林","zh_bookname":"那个男人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.72],"goodreads_ratings":[9395],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["那个男人"],"author":["Rudyard Kipling"],"zh_author":["吉卜林"],"bookname":["The Man Who Was"]}}

Here are some of the remarkable features of *Barnes &amp; Noble Classics*: All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. *Barnes &amp; Noble Classics *pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Action, adventure, and excitement spill from the pages of **Rudyard Kipling**’s best-loved collections of stories, *The Jungle Books*. Set in magical, mysterious India, these tales of people and animals living together--though not always harmoniously--in the world of nature have appealed equally to children and adults since their first appearance more than a century ago. Most focus on Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves. As Baloo the sleepy brown bear, Bagheera the cunning black panther, Kaa the python, and his other animal friends teach their beloved man-cub” the ways of the jungle, Mowgli gains the strength and wisdom he needs for his frightful fight with Shere Khan, the tiger who robbed him of his human family. But there are also the tales of Rikki-tikki-tavi the mongoose and his great war” against the vicious cobras Nag and Nagaina; of Toomai, who watches the elephants dance; and of Kotick the white seal, who swims in the Bering Sea. This edition includes both the original *Jungle Book* (1894) and *The Second Jungle Book* (1895), written in response to the original’s enormous success. **Lisa Makman**** is visiting Assistant Professor of English at the University of Michigan.

When she was still a child, Lucy Nelson had her alcoholic failure of a father thrown in jail. Ever since then she has been trying to reform the men around her, even if that ultimately means destroying herself in the process. With his unerring portraits of Lucy and her hapless, childlike husband, Roy, Roth has created an uncompromising work of fictional realism, a vision of provincial American piety, yearning, and discontent that is at once pitiless and compassionate.

Reading at times like a buttoned-down Indignation records a series of small explosions against '50s propriety and the dire consequences they lead to, capturing the misery of desire amid repression, along with the greater terror of being trapped in endless, relentless memory. --Tom Nissley From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Roth's brilliant and disconcerting new novel plumbs the depths of the early Cold War era male libido, burdened as it is with sexual myths and a consciousness overloaded with vivid images of impending death, either by the bomb or in Korea. At least this is the way things appear to narrator Marcus Messner, the 19-year-old son of a Newark kosher butcher. Perhaps because Marcus's dad saw his two brothers' only sons die in WWII, he becomes an overprotective paranoid when Marcus turns 18, prompting Marcus to flee to Winesburg College in Ohio. Though the distance helps, Marcus, too, is haunted by the idea that flunking out of college means going to Korea. His first date in Winesburg is with doctor's daughter Olivia Hutton, who would appear to embody the beautiful normality Marcus seeks, but, instead, she destroys Marcus's sense of normal by surprising him after dinner with her carnal prowess. Slightly unhinged by this stroke of fortune, he at first shuns her, then pesters her with letters and finally has a brief but nonpenetrative affair with her. Olivia, he discovers, is psychologically fragile and bears scars from a suicide attempt a mark Marcus's mother zeroes in on when she meets the girl for the first and last time. Between promising his mother to drop her and longing for her, Marcus goes through a common enough existential crisis, exacerbated by run-ins with the school administration over trivial matters that quickly become more serious.... The terrible sadness of Marcus's life is rendered palpable by Roth's fierce grasp on the psychology of this butcher's boy, down to his bought-for-Winesburg wardrobe. It's a melancholy triumph and a cogent reflection on society in a time of war. (Sept.) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As young Texas Rangers, Gus and Call have much to learn about survival in a land fraught with perils: not only the blazing heat and raging tornadoes, roiling rivers and merciless Indians but also the deadly whims of soldiers. On their first expeditions--led by incompetent officers and accompanied by the robust, dauntless whore known as the Great Western--they will face death at the hands of the cunning Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and the silent Apache Gomez. They will be astonished by the Mexican army. And Gus will meet the love of his life. Amazon.com Review In this prequel to McMurtry's 1986 Pulitzer Prize-winning Lonesome Dove , Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call are invincible young bucks, Texas Rangers, full of youthful energy and, quite frankly, full of themselves. That is until they're utterly consumed by the vicious battlefield of the early-19th-century Wild West. Their journey takes them across barren deserts and raging rivers and through steep and snowy mountains, often on foot and with barely enough provisions and clothing to keep them from certain death. The constant threat of attack by Comanches keeps them awake nights, fearing for their lives--and for good reason. ''Buffalo Hump reached down and grabbed the terrified boy by his long black hair. He yanked his horse to a stop, lifted Zeke Moody off his feet, and slashed at his head with a knife, just above the boy's ears. Then he whirled and raced across the front of the huddled Rangers, dragging Zeke by the hair. As the horse increased its speed, the scalp tore loose and Zeke fell free. Buffalo Hump had whirled again, and held aloft the bloody scalp.'' This bedraggled group of adventurers--on their foolhardy expedition to seize Santa Fe from the Mexicans (who also prove to be formidable enemies)--includes a salty assortment of cowboys, scouts, fortune seekers, and a fat and sassy whore nicknamed ''The Great Western.'' McMurtry's adept storytelling paints a portrait of the Wild West that at times is palpable. One can almost smell the campfires, the body odors, and the long-awaited piece of meat after weeks without a proper meal. Dead Man's Walk will satisfy your craving for adventure, without having to put your life on the line. From Publishers Weekly Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae, the heroes of Lonesome Dove, return in a rousing if slightly contrived yarn set decades before the events of that Pulitzer Prize-winning novel?and earlier still than the latter-day adventures of Call, detailed in Streets of Laredo. Now hardly more than teenage runaways, the pair, just recruited into the ragtag Rangers of the new Texas Republic, come face-to-face with death on their baptismal patrol as Gus, foolishly wandering away from his guard post, stumbles onto the grotesquely disfigured Comanche chief Buffalo Hump and narrowly escapes with the Indian's lance embedded in his hip. Gus and Call return safely to San Antonio but, lured by myths of silver and gold, the hapless duo sign on to a small army led by a former seafaring pirate intent on liberating Santa Fe from Mexican rule. An unforgettable (and equally unlikely) crew of blackhearted villains, foppish officers and star-crossed heroes and heroines, the sorry little force heads west only to be terrorized by Buffalo Hump, then captured by Mexican militia. With the ruthless Captain Salazar calling the shots, Mexicans and Americans are ordered to march toward El Paso. Along the way, Call is whipped nearly to death for a minor offense, and the group is stalked by a murderous Apache. Forced by Salazar to cross the high desert known as ''dead man's walk,'' Gus, Call and company end up at a leper colony near El Paso, where they find salvation. Suffering from McMurtry's usual coincidences and miraculous escapes, as well as from some stereotypical key characters and too much obvious melodrama, this falls short of both Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo.

Mark Coffin of California was barely thirty years old when he won a startling upset victory in his race for a seat in the U.S. Senate. A bright, handsome, energetic idealist with a passion for decency in government, he thought his honesty and dedication would see him through anything. But Washington, DC, was all too eager to teach him the hard lessons of gamesmanship and compromise. Neither Mark Coffin nor his wife were prepared for what Washington had in store for them: the bizarre sex scandal that would threaten to destroy not only Mark Coffin's career and his personal life, but all of the political reforms he was fighting so desperately to achieve. Mark Coffin, U.S.S. is a magnificent novel of Washington politics-an insider's view of power at the top, shown through the eyes of vivid, fascinating, and humanly likable characters.

In the clammy forests of Louisiana, somewhere between New Orleans and the muddy Mississippi River, the berry-stained bandit of the woods, Jamie Lockhart, saves the life of a gullible planter. In reward, Jamie is given shelter only to kidnap the planter s lovely young daughter, Rosamund. It s an impulsive act that will have far-reaching consequences, and will set in motion a series of fantastic, murderous, and flamboyantly uncivilized romantic adventures. With legendary figures of Mississippi s past including notorious riverboatman Mike Fink and the thrill-killing Harp brothers mingling side-by-side with characters from legendary fairy tales and the author s own imagination, The Robber Bridegroom in an exuberant cocktail of fantasy, folklore and history along the treacherous Natchez Trace. The basis of the popular musical that has run both on and off Broadway, The Robber Bridegroom is a modern fairy tale, where irony and humor, outright nonsense, deep wisdom and surrealistic extravaganzas becomes a poetic unity through the power of a pure exquisite style ( The New York Times ) .

In this boldly ambitious and symphonic novel, she captures the tenor of our times and offers an unsettling glimpse of the future. Fashion model Charlotte Swenson returns to Manhattan, having just recovered from a catastrophic car accident in her hometown of Rockford, Illinois. The skin of her face is perfect, but behind it lie eighty titanium screws that hold together the bones that were shattered when she hit the unbreakable windscreen of her car. Unrecognizable to her peers and colleagues, Charlotte finds it impossible to resume her former life. Instead, she floats invisibly through a world of fashion nightclubs and edgy Internet projects, where image and reality are indistinguishable. During her recovery in Rockford, she had met another Charlotte, the plain-looking teenage daughter of her former best friend. Young Charlotte, alienated from parents and friends, has come under the sway of two men: her uncle, a mentally unstable scholar of the Industrial Revolution, and an enigmatic high school teacher whom she seduces. In following these tales to their eerie convergence, Look at Me is both a send-up of image culture in America and a mystery of human identity. Egan illuminates the difficulties of shaping an inner life in a culture obsessed with surfaces and asks whether ''truth'' can have any meaning in an era when reality itself has become a style. Written with powerful intelligence and grace, Look at Me clearly establishes Jennifer Egan as one of the most daring and gifted novelists of her generation.

The young writer was struggling with his first novel, Lie Down in Darkness, and he was nervous about whether his \"strain and toil\" would amount to anything. \"When I mature and broaden,\" Styron told Blackburn, \"I expect to use the language on as exalted and elevated a level as I can sustain. I believe that a writer should accommodate language to his own peculiar personality, and mine wants to use great words, evocative words, when the situation demands them.\" In 1953, Styron was awarded the Rome Prize of the American Academy in Rome, which crowned him a literary star.

It even appears sporadically in his poetry.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd1eb48685135a1e289d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.41,"goodreads_ratings":22,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29deedb486852b17da540e","5c29deedb486852b17da540f","5c29deedb486852b17da5410","5c29deedb486852b17da5411","5c29deedb486852b17da5412","5c29deedb486852b17da5413","5c29deedb486852b17da5414","5c29deedb486852b17da5415","5c29deedb486852b17da5416","5c29deedb486852b17da5417","5c29deedb486852b17da5418","5c29deedb486852b17da5419","5c29deedb486852b17da541a"],"year":"2015","zh_author":"皮兰德娄","zh_bookname":"自杀故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.41],"goodreads_ratings":[22],"year":["2015"],"zh_bookname":["自杀故事"],"author":["Luigi Pirandello"],"zh_author":["皮兰德娄"],"bookname":["Tales of Suicide"]}}

But young Jody Baxter is not content with these electrifying escapades, or even with the cozy comfort of home with Pa and Ma. He wants a pet, a friend with whom he can share his quiet cogitations and his corn pone. Jody gets his pet, a frisky fawn he calls Flag, but that's not all. With Flag comes a year of life lessons, frolicking times, and achingly hard decisions. This powerful book is as compelling now as when it was written over 60 years ago. Read simply as a naturalist study of the Florida interior, it fascinates and entices. Add the heart-stopping adventure and heart-wrenching human elements, and this is a classic well worth its Pulitzer Prize. Earthy dialect and homespun wisdom season the story, giving it a unique and unforgettable flavor, and N.C. Wyeth's warm, soft illustrations capture an era of rough subsistence and sweet survival. (Ages 12 and older) --Emilie Coulter From the Publisher In this classic story of the Baxter family of inland Florida and their wild, hard, satisfying life, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings has written one of the great novels of our times. A rich and varied story - tender in its understanding of boyhood, crowded with the excitement of the backwoods hunt, with vivid descriptions of the primitive, beautiful hammock country, with humor and earthy philosophy - The Yearling is a novel for readers of all tastes and ages. Its glowing picture of life that is far and refreshingly removed from modern patterns of living becomes universal in its revelation of simple courageous people and the abiding beliefs they live by. Winner of Pulitzer Prize in 1938, The Yearling was made available the following year in a special edition illustrated by the distinguished American artist, N.C. Wyeth. The original paintings have been re-photographed and new plates made for this handsome volume.END","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd16b48685135a1dedcc.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"San Val","segments":["5c29de84b486852b17da2790","5c29de84b486852b17da2791","5c29de84b486852b17da2792","5c29de84b486852b17da2793","5c29de84b486852b17da2794","5c29de84b486852b17da2795","5c29de84b486852b17da2796","5c29de84b486852b17da2797","5c29de84b486852b17da2798","5c29de84b486852b17da2799","5c29de84b486852b17da279a","5c29de84b486852b17da279b","5c29de84b486852b17da279c","5c29de84b486852b17da279d","5c29de84b486852b17da279e","5c29de84b486852b17da279f","5c29de84b486852b17da27a0","5c29de84b486852b17da27a1","5c29de84b486852b17da27a2","5c29de84b486852b17da27a3","5c29de84b486852b17da27a4","5c29de84b486852b17da27a5","5c29de84b486852b17da27a6","5c29de84b486852b17da27a7","5c29de84b486852b17da27a8","5c29de84b486852b17da27a9","5c29de84b486852b17da27aa","5c29de84b486852b17da27ab","5c29de84b486852b17da27ac","5c29de84b486852b17da27ad","5c29de84b486852b17da27ae","5c29de84b486852b17da27af","5c29de84b486852b17da27b0"],"year":"1938","zh_author":"玛 金 罗琳斯","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"一年生"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1938"],"zh_bookname":["一年生"],"author":["Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings"],"zh_author":["玛 金 罗琳斯"],"bookname":["The Yearling"]}}

In The Hope, which opens in 1948 and culminates in the miraculous triumph of 1967s Six-Day War, Wouk plunges the reader into the story of a nation struggling for its birth and then its survival. As the tale resumes in The Glory, Wouk portrays the young nation once again pushed to the brink of annihilationand sets the stage for todays ongoing struggle for peace. Taking us from the Sinai to the Jerusalem, from dust-choking battles to the Entebbe raid, from Camp David to the inner lives of such historical figures as Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, and Anwar Sadat, these extraordinary novels have the authenticity and authority of Wouks finest fictionand together strike a resounding chord of hope for all humanity. The first trade paperback editions of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, Wouks epic novels of World War II, were recently released by Back Bay Books. From Publishers Weekly In the Historical Notes to this solid saga encapsulating three Israeli-Arab wars, Wouk makes astute reference to the element that gives the novel its considerable power: he refers to his \"arduous personal research . . . which is one reason that my books appear at long intervals.\" Conceding the impossibility of using \"cool perspective\" about events so recent and often still hotly debated, he then clarifies which episodes in the novel are based on fact. These accounts of specific battles, behind-the-scenes political skirmishes in Israel and diplomatic strategy in Washington, D.C., provide the novel's fascinating historical background and true drama. Among and between his accounts of the 1948 War of Independence, the Suez crisis and the Six-Day War, Wouk weaves a story of two protagonists and their fortunes in love and war. Young Polish immigrant Yossi Blumenthal first distinguishes himself in battle in such a reckless manner that he is dubbed Don Kishote; he goes on to become a military hero. His first commander, Zev Barak, is \"sidelined\" into diplomacy and becomes an attache in Washington. Such actual figures as David Ben Gurion, Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir and others are depicted with candor and credibility. While his account is sympathetic to Israel, Wouk does not paint the Arabs with a tarred brush; nor does he put a false gloss on less-than-admirable episodes in the short history of the Jewish nation. Though his prose at times peregrinates into the pedestrian, Wouk has not lost his touch: this is an engrossing and often moving tale. Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal Wouk's newest novel covers Israel's history from the new state's first battle for survival in 1948 through its joyous victory in the Six-Day War of 1967. In the style of Winds of War ( LJ 11/1/71) and War and Remembrance ( LJ 10/15/78), it tells a story of relationships and human lives in the midst of political and social turmoil. (Notes at the back describe the actual events used as background.) The historical figures are here: Eshkol and Eban, Ben Gurion and Dayan are all woven into the fictional drama of Zev Barak, Don Kishote Nitzan, their families, and close friends. Sadly, Wouk's women are still \"handmaidens of men,\" but the ongoing chronicle of politics, intrigue, and nation-building provides an exciting and involving adventure. This is good reading, sure to be sought by those who have read Wouk's earlier novels and enjoyed by many new fans as well.

From Library Journal In Wouk's newest work, you'll meet Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, and Henry Kissinger, along with the second generation of the military family in his recent New York Times best seller, The Hope. A Doubleday Book Club and Literary Guild alternate selection. Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Booklist This is the sequel to The Hope (1993), which dramatized the unlikely course of modern Israel's history, ending with its smashing victory over the Arabs in 1967. As in previous sagas of Woukian dimensions, The Winds of War to name one of a dozen, ordinary people become heroic figures against a turbulent backdrop of war, death, and love. As emotional encapsulations of this century's ghastly and glorious Jewish experience, Wouk's epics have been automatically popular, regardless of their schmaltzy, made-for-TV texture. Here he places a dozen military characters and their families in crucial roles in the post-'67 fighting: the Barak family has a military attach{ }e in the Washington embassy and a son on a gunboat; the Luries fly fighters; and the Pasternaks lurk in the Mossad's shadows. From such vantage points, they fight along and over the Suez Canal and fend off disaster in the Yom Kippur War, pull off the exhilarating Entebbe rescue, and bomb Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981, an endpoint that leaves out the less triumphant '80s. Wouk humanizes these intense events with scenes of passage (affairs, weddings, funerals) and mixes in real Israeli leaders such as Golda Meir, Dayan, Sharon, and Rabin, who consult with his characters. While action-minded readers await a possible televised adaptation, this spacious panorama of battle should sustain their interest.

In 1850s China, a young girl, Peony, is sold to work as a bondmaid for a rich Jewish family in Kaifeng. Jews have lived for centuries in this region of the country, but by the mid-nineteenth century, assimilation has begun taking its toll on their small enclave. When Peony and the family s son, David, grow up and fall in love with one another, they face strong opposition from every side. Tradition forbids the marriage, and the family already has a rabbi s daughter in mind for David. Long celebrated for its subtle and even-handed treatment of colliding traditions, Peony is an engaging coming-of-age story about love, identity, and the tragedy and beauty found at the intersection of two disparate cultures.

Buck's most autobiographical novels, The Time Is Noon was kept from publication for decades on account of its personal resonance. The book tells the story of Joan Richards and her journey of self-discovery during the first half of the twentieth century. As a child, family and small-town life obscure Joan's individuality; as an adult, it's inhibited by an unhappy marriage. After breaking free of the latter, she begins a stark reassessment of the way she's been living and to her surprise, learns to appreciate all that lies ahead. The Time Is Noon is a humble, elegant tale of chances lost and reclaimed, and remains beautifully affirming today.This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S.

Lewis, was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Possibly the greatest satirist of his age, Lewis wrote novels that present a devastating picture of middle-class American life in the 1920s. Although he ridiculed the values, the lifestyles, and even the speech of his characters, there is often affection behind the irony. Lewis began his career as a journalist, editor, and hack writer. He became an important literary figure with the publication of Main Street. His seventh novel, Babbitt, is considered by many critics to be his greatest work. One of his major works The Job begins: Captain Lew Golden would have saved any foreign observer a great deal of trouble in studying America. He was an almost perfect type of the petty small-town middle-class lawyer. He lived in Panama, Pennsylvania. He had never been captain of anything except the Crescent Volunteer Fire Company, but he owned the title because he collected rents, wrote insurance, and meddled with lawsuits.

In this beguiling novel, originally published in Arabic in 1985, Mahfouz tells with extraordinary insight the story of the \"heretic pharaoh,\" or \"sun king,\"--the first known monotheistic ruler--whose iconoclastic and controversial reign during the 18th Dynasty (1540-1307 B.C.) has uncanny resonance with modern sensibilities. Narrating the novel is a young man with a passion for the truth, who questions the pharaoh's contemporaries after his horrible death--including Akhenaten's closest friends, his most bitter enemies, and finally his enigmatic wife, Nefertiti--in an effort to discover what really happened in those strange, dark days at Akhenaten's court. As our narrator and each of the subjects he interviews contribute their version of Akhenaten, \"the truth\" becomes increasingly evanescent. Akhenaten encompasses all of the contradictions his subjects see in him: at once cruel and empathic, feminine and barbaric, mad and divinely inspired, his character, as Mahfouz imagines him, is eerily modern, and fascinatingly ethereal. An ambitious and exceptionally lucid and accessible book, Akhenaten is a work only Mahfouz could render so elegantly, so irresistibly.

With each new work, she attacks - with a clear-eyed lack of sentimentality, and an understanding of the darkest depths of the human soul - the inextricable link between personal life and political, communal history. The revelation of this theme in each new work, not only in her homeland South Africa, but the twenty-first century world, is evidence of her literary genius: in the sharpness of her psychological insights, the stark beauty of her language, the complexity of her characters and the difficult choices with which they are faced.

Notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932. John Galsworthy was born at Kingston Hill in Surrey, England, the son of John and Blanche Bailey (nee Bartleet) Galsworthy. His family was wealthy and well established, with a large estate in Kingston upon Thames that is now the site of three schools: Marymount International School, Rokeby Preparatory School, and Holy Cross. He attended Harrow and New College, Oxford, training as a barrister, and was called to the bar in 1890. However, he was not keen to begin practising law and instead travelled abroad to look after the family's shipping business. During these travels he met Joseph Conrad, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbour of Adelaide, Australia, and the two future novelists became close friends. In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper (1864-1956), the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. After her divorce ten years later, they married 23 September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933. Before their marriage, they often stayed clandestinely in a farmhouse called Wingstone in the village of Manaton on Dartmoor, Devon. From 1908 he took out a long lease on part of the building and made it their regular second home until 1923.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd20b48685135a1e3a4d.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29df15b486852b17da654c","5c29df15b486852b17da654d","5c29df15b486852b17da654e","5c29df15b486852b17da654f","5c29df15b486852b17da6550","5c29df15b486852b17da6551","5c29df15b486852b17da6552","5c29df15b486852b17da6553"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 高尔斯华绥","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"大厅标记及其他"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["大厅标记及其他"],"author":["John Galsworthy"],"zh_author":["约翰 高尔斯华绥"],"bookname":["Hall-Marked and Others"]}}

Here a handful of Creole families eke out a meager existence by fishing the Gulf waters. Such is the fate of Al Landry and his seventeen-year-old daughter, Annie. All Annie has ever known is the wild sea, but she longs for other people and places, including the glamor of life in the Big Easy. When a cruel, handsome man from the city passes through, he kindles Annie's fantasies for a life beyond the island. Soon, the young girl faces a decision: remain planted in the predictable life she has always known, or toss it all aside for her dreamed-of adventure.

Originally published in the 1930s and 1940s in magazines which run the gamut from obscure leftist literary periodicals, through The New Republic and The Atlantic Monthly, to mass circulation glossies like Colliers and Cosmopolitan, these stories deal with themes and use techniques which are not generally considered to be \"Cheeveresque.\" They will undoubtedly surprise those readers familiar only with Cheever's post-1947 work. Each of these early stories bears the unmistakable stamp of the master storyteller. \"Bayonne\" is an evocative character study of a waitress whose work serving blue-collar regulars in a diner provides her with more emotional than financial support. \"In Passing, \" which ends with the radical organizer Girsdansky haranguing a small unmoved crowd on the Boston Common at twilight, reveals perhaps more about states of mind during the Depression than standard histories of that era. \"Fall River\" is an elegy on economic catastrophe in a backwater New England town: Cheever calls up a picture of a wasteland with abandoned factories where \"the looms blocked off the floor like discarded machinery in an old opera house.\" \"The Autobiography of a Drummer\" is a remarkable portrait of a man who has outlived his time. It anticipates Arthur Miller's Willy Loman by more than a decade. In this intriguing collection, Cheever plunges us into a stark world; the scenes are reminiscent of Edward Hopper. It is a world of foreclosures, down-and-outs, burlesque shows, desperate gamblers, and deferred hopes. It adds a new dimension to the assessment ofJohn Cheever's considerable reputation.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd3bb48685135a1ef8dd.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.82,"goodreads_ratings":73,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e085b486852b17db0266","5c29e085b486852b17db0267","5c29e085b486852b17db0268","5c29e085b486852b17db0269","5c29e085b486852b17db026a"],"year":"","zh_author":"约翰 契佛","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"十三藏故事"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.82],"goodreads_ratings":[73],"year":[""],"zh_bookname":["十三藏故事"],"author":["John Cheever"],"zh_author":["约翰 契佛"],"bookname":["Thirteen Uncollected Stories"]}}

He's still divorced, though his ex-wife, to his dismay, has remarried and moved along with their children to Connecticut. But Frank is happy enough in his work and pursuing various civic and entrepreneurial sidelines. He has high hopes for this 4th of July weekend: a search for a house for deeply hapless clients relocating to Vermont; a rendezvous on the Jersey shore with his girlfriend; then up to Connecticut to pick up his larcenous and emotionally troubled teenage son and visit as many sports halls of fame as they can fit into two days. Frank's Independence Day, however, turns out not as he'd planned, and this decent, appealingly bewildered, profoundly observant man is wrenched, gradually and inevitably, out of his private refuge. Independence Day captures the mystery of life in all its conflicted glory with grand humour, intense compassion and transfixing power.From the Trade Paperback edition.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd9cb48685135a2156e4.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.86,"goodreads_ratings":13589,"level":3,"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","segments":["5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0cb","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0cc","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0cd","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0ce","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0cf","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d0","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d1","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d2","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d3","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d4","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d5","5c29e4dcb486852b17dce0d6"],"year":"2010","zh_author":"理查德 福特","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"独立日"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.86],"goodreads_ratings":[13589],"year":["2010"],"zh_bookname":["独立日"],"author":["Richard Ford"],"zh_author":["理查德 福特"],"bookname":["Independence Day"]}}

In his trio of world-acclaimed novels portraying the life of an entire American generation, Richard Ford has imagined one of the most indelible and widely discussed characters in modern literature, Frank Bascombe. Through Bascombe protean, funny, profane, wise, often inappropriate we've witnessed the aspirations, sorrows, longings, achievements and failings of an American life in the twilight of the twentieth century. Now, in Let Me Be Frank with You, Ford reinvents Bascombe in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

When Bitsy and Brad Donaldson and Sami and Ziba Yazdan both adopt Korean infant girls, their chance encounter at the Baltimore airport the day their daughters arrive marks the start of a long, intense if sometimes awkward friendship. Sami's mother, Maryam Yazdan, who carefully preserves her exotic \"outsiderness\" despite having emigrated from Iran almost 40 years earlier, is frequently perplexed by her son and daughter-in-law's ongoing relationship with the loud, opinionated, unapologetically American Donaldsons. When Bitsy's recently widowed father, Dave, endearingly falls in love with Maryam, she must come to terms with what it means to be part of a culture and a country. Stretching from the babies' arrival in 1997 until 2004, the novel is punctuated by each year's Arrival Party, a tradition manufactured and comically upheld by Bitsy; the annual festivities gradually reveal the families' evolving connections. Though the novel's perspective shifts among characters, Maryam is at the narrative and emotional heart of the touching, humorous story, as she reluctantly realizes that there may be a place in her heart for new friends, new loves and her new country after all. (May 9) Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. From School Library Journal Adult/High School Two families arrive at the Baltimore/Washington International Airport in August 1997 to claim the Korean infants they have adopted. Strangers until that evening, they are destined to begin a friendship that will span their adoptive daughters' childhoods. Bitsy and Brad Donaldson are the quintessential middle-class, white American couple. Sami and Ziba Yazdan are Iranian Americans. From the beginning, the differences in the ways they will raise their daughters are obvious: Bitsy's well-meaning but overzealous efforts to retain her child's Korean heritage are evident in the chosen name Jin-Ho and in the Korean costumes that she dresses the girl in every year as they mark the anniversary of the adoption date. The Yazdans are comfortable with their daughter Susan's assimilation into their own Iranian-American culture. When Bitsy's widowed father begins to show romantic interest in Susan's grandmother, cultural differences are brought to a head. Tyler weaves a story that speaks to how we come to terms with our identity in multicultural America, and how we form friendships that move beyond the unease of differences. She does not dwell on the September 11 attacks, but subtly portrays the distrust that the Yazdans have to endure in the following months. Tyler's gift, as in her other novels, is her ability to infuse the commonplace with meaning and grace, and teens will appreciate her perceptiveness in exploring relationships within and between families across the cultural spectrum.

Maggie is a meddler and as she and her husband, Ira, drive 90 miles to the funeral of an old friend, Ira contemplates his wasted life and the traffic, while Maggie hatches a plant to reunite her son Jesse with his long-estranged wife and baby. As Ira explains, ''She thinks the people she loves are better than they really are, and so then she starts changing things around to suit her view of them.'' Though everyone criticizes her for being ''ordinary,'' Maggie's ability to see the beauty and potential in others ultimately proves that she is the only one fighting the resignation they all fear. The book captured the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1989. From Publishers Weekly In perhaps her most mainstream, accessible novel so far, Tyler spins a tale of marriage and middle-class lives, in an age when social standards and life expectations have gone askew. While she remains a brilliant observer of human nature, there is a subtle change here in Tyler's focus. Where before her protagonists were eccentric, sometimes slightly fantastical characters who came at the end to a sense of peace, if not happiness, Maggie Moran and her husband Ira are average, unexceptional, even somewhat drab; and outside of some small epiphanies, little is changed between them at the story's close. It's this very realism that makes the story so effective and moving. Taking place on one summer day, when Maggie and Ira drive from Baltimore to Pennsylvania to a funeral, with an accidental detour involving an old black man they pass on the road and a side trip to see their former daughter-in-law and their seven-year-old grandchild, the novel reveals the basic incompatibility of their 28-year marriage and the love that binds them together nonetheless. This is another typical Tyler union of opposites: Maggie is impetuous, scatterbrained, klutzy, accident prone and garrulous; Ira is self-contained, precise, dignified, aloof with, however, an irritating (or endearing ) habit of whistling tunes that betray his inner thoughts. Both feel that their children are strangers, that the generations are ''sliding downhill,'' and that somehow they have gone wrong in a society whose values they no longer recognize. With irresistibly funny passages you want to read out loud and poignant insights that illuminate the serious business of sharing lives in an unsettling world, this is Tyler's best novel yet. 175,000 first printing ; BOMC main selection; Franklin Library signed first edition.

But he is troubled by his inability to remember anything about the first night that he moved into his new, spare, and efficient condominium on the outskirts of Baltimore.

Now with special bonus material by Michael Chabon. A towering, swash-buckling thrill of a book ( Newsweek ), hailed as Chabon s magnum opus ( The New York Review of Books ), The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a triumph of originality, imagination, and storytelling, an exuberant, irresistible novel that begins in New York City in 1939. A young escape artist and budding magician named Joe Kavalier arrives on the doorstep of his cousin, Sammy Clay. While the long shadow of Hitler falls across Europe, America is happily in thrall to the Golden Age of comic books, and in a distant corner of Brooklyn, Sammy is looking for a way to cash in on the craze. He finds the ideal partner in the aloof, artistically gifted Joe, and together they embark on an adventure that takes them deep into the heart of Manhattan, and the heart of old-fashioned American ambition. From the shared fears, dreams, and desires of two teenage boys, they spin comic book tales of the heroic, fascist-fighting Escapist and the beautiful, mysterious Luna Moth, otherworldly mistress of the night. Climbing from the streets of Brooklyn to the top of the Empire State Building, Joe and Sammy carve out lives, and careers, as vivid as cyan and magenta ink. Spanning continents and eras, this superb book by one of America s finest writers remains one of the defining novels of our modern American age. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, and Los Angeles Times Book Prize Winner of the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award and the New York Society Library Book Award Named one of the 10 Best Books of the Decade by Entertainment Weekly Amazon.com Review Like the comic books that animate and inspire it, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is both larger than life and of it too. Complete with golems and magic and miraculous escapes and evil nemeses and even hand-to-hand Antarctic battle, it pursues the most important questions of love and war, dreams and art, across pages brimming with longing and hope. Samuel Klayman--self-described little man, city boy, and Jew--first meets Josef Kavalier when his mother shoves him aside in his own bed, telling him to make room for their cousin, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Prague. It's the beginning, however unlikely, of a beautiful friendship. In short order, Sam's talent for pulp plotting meets Joe's faultless, academy-trained line, and a comic-book superhero is born. A sort of lantern-jawed equalizer clad in dark blue long underwear, the Escapist \"roams the globe, performing amazing feats and coming to the aid of those who languish in tyranny's chains!\" Before they know it, Kavalier and Clay (as Sam Klayman has come to be known) find themselves at the epicenter of comics' golden age. But Joe Kavalier is driven by motives far more complex than your average hack. In fact, his first act as a comic-book artist is to deal Hitler a very literal blow. (The cover of the first issue shows the Escapist delivering \"an immortal haymaker\" onto the F hrer's realistically bloody jaw.) In subsequent years, the Escapist and his superhero allies take on the evil Iron Chain and their leader Attila Haxoff--their battles drawn with an intensity that grows more disturbing as Joe's efforts to rescue his family fail. He's fighting their war with brush and ink, Joe thinks, and the idea sustains him long enough to meet the beautiful Rosa Saks, a surrealist artist and surprisingly retrograde muse. But when even that fiction fails him, Joe performs an escape of his own, leaving Rosa and Sammy to pick up the pieces in some increasingly wrong-headed ways. More amazing adventures follow--but reader, why spoil the fun? Suffice to say, Michael Chabon writes novels like the Escapist busts locks. Previous books such as The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Wonder Boys have prose of equal shimmer and wit, and yet here he seems to have finally found a canvas big enough for his gifts. The whole enterprise seems animated by love: for his alternately deluded, damaged, and painfully sincere characters; for the quirks and curious innocence of tough-talking wartime New York; and, above all, for comics themselves, \"the inspirations and lucubrations of five hundred aging boys dreaming as hard as they could.\" Far from negating such pleasures, the Holocaust's presence in the novel only makes them more pressing. Art, if not capable of actually fighting evil, can at least offer a gesture of defiance and hope--a way out, in other words, of a world gone completely mad. Comic-book critics, Joe notices, dwell on \"the pernicious effect, on young minds, of satisfying the desire to escape. As if there could be any more noble or necessary service in life.\" Indeed. --Mary Park From Booklist Virtuoso Chabon takes intense delight in the practice of his art, and never has his joy been more palpable than in this funny and profound tale of exile, love, and magic. In his last novel, The Wonder Boys (1995), Chabon explored the shadow side of literary aspirations. Here he revels in the crass yet inventive and comforting world of comic-book superheroes, those masked men with mysterious powers who were born in the wake of the Great Depression and who carried their fans through the horrors of war with the guarantee that good always triumphs over evil. In a luxuriant narrative that is jubilant and purposeful, graceful and complex, hilarious and enrapturing, Chabon chronicles the fantastic adventures of two Jewish cousins, one American, one Czech. It's 1939 and Brooklynite Sammy Klayman dreams of making it big in the nascent world of comic books. Joseph Kavalier has never seen a comic book, but he is an accomplished artist versed in the \"autoliberation\" techniques of his hero, Harry Houdini. He effects a great (and surreal) escape from the Nazis, arrives in New York, and joins forces with Sammy. They rapidly create the Escapist, the first of many superheroes emblematic of their temperaments and predicaments, and attain phenomenal success. But Joe, tormented by guilt and grief for his lost family, abruptly joins the navy, abandoning Sammy, their work, and his lover, the marvelous artist and free spirit Rosa, who, unbeknownst to him, is carrying his child. As Chabon--equally adept at atmosphere, action, dialogue, and cultural commentary--whips up wildly imaginative escapades punctuated by schtick that rivals the best of Jewish comedians, he plumbs the depths of the human heart and celebrates the healing properties of escapism and the \"genuine magic of art\" with exuberance and wisdom.

Known for her historical fiction, which won her the Nobel Prize for literature in 1928, Undset based this factual work on primary sources, her own experiences living in Italy, and her profound understanding of the human heart. One of the greatest novelists of the twentieth century, Undset was no stranger to hagiography. Her meticulous research of medieval times, which bore such fruit in her multi-volume masterpieces Kristin Lavransdatter and The Master of Hestviken , acquainted her with some of the holy men and women produced by the Age of Faith. Their exemplary lives left a deep impression upon the author, an impression Undset credited as one of her reasons for entering the Church in 1924. Catherine of Siena was a particular favorite of Undset, who also was a Third Order Dominican. An extraordinarily active, intelligent, and courageous woman, Catherine at an early age devoted herself to the love of God. The intensity of her prayer, sacrifice, and service to the poor won her a reputation for holiness and wisdom, and she was called upon to make peace between warring nobles. Believing that peace in Italy could be achieved only if the Pope, then living in France, returned to Rome, Catherine boldly traveled to Avignon to meet with Pope Gregory XI. With sensitivity to the zealous love of God and man that permeated the life of Saint Catherine, Undset presents a most moving and memorable portrait of one of the greatest women of all time.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62ddd7b48685135a2283eb.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.27,"goodreads_ratings":400,"level":3,"publisher":"Ignatius Press","segments":["5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd95","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd96","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd97","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd98","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd99","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9a","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9b","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9c","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9d","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9e","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcd9f","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda0","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda1","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda2","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda3","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda4","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda5","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda6","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda7","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda8","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcda9","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdaa","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdab","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdac","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdad","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdae","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdaf","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdb0","5c29e6d7b486852b17ddcdb1"],"year":"2009","zh_author":"西格里德 温塞特","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"锡耶纳的凯瑟琳"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.27],"goodreads_ratings":[400],"year":["2009"],"zh_bookname":["锡耶纳的凯瑟琳"],"author":["Sigrid Undset"],"zh_author":["西格里德 温塞特"],"bookname":["Catherine Of Siena"]}}

When journalist Daniel Quinn meets Ernest Hemingway at the Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba, in 1957, he has no idea that his own affinity for simple, declarative sentences will change his life radically overnight. So begins William Kennedy's latest novel-a tale of revolutionary intrigue, heroic journalism, crooked politicians, drug-running gangsters, Albany race riots, and the improbable rise of Fidel Castro. Quinn's epic journey carries him through the nightclubs and jungles of Cuba and into the newsrooms and racially charged streets of Albany on the day Robert Kennedy is fatally shot in 1968. The odyssey brings Quinn, and his exotic but unpredictable Cuban wife, Renata, a debutante revolutionary, face-to-face with the darkest facets of human nature and illuminates the power of love in the presence of death.

McCarthy transforms commonplace brushes with humanity - in homesteads, stores and in the woods - into stunning scenes of the comic and the grotesque, and as the story hurtles toward its unforgettable conclusion, depicts the most sordid aspects of life with dignity, humour, and characteristic lyrical brilliance.

But there are complications: Frank, whose reaction to Jews is ambivalent, falls in love with Helen Bober; at the same time he begins to steal from the store.

The orphan Alfgrimur has spent an idyllic childhood sheltered in the simple turf cottage of a generous and eccentric elderly couple. Alfgrimur dreams only of becoming a fisherman like his adoptive grandfather, until he meets Iceland's biggest celebrity.

This is as completely different from Tortilla Flat and In Dubious Battle as they are from each other. Only in his complete understanding of the proletarian mentality does he sustain a connecting link - though this is assuredly not a \"proletarian novel\". It is oddly absorbing - this picture of the strange friendship between the strong man and the giant with the mind of a not-quite-bright child. Driven from job to job by the failure of the giant child to fit into the social pattern, they finally find - in a ranch - what they feel their chance to achieve a homely dream they have built. There's a simplicity, a directness, a poignancy in the story that gives it a singular power, difficult to define. Steinbeck is a genius - and an original. (_Kirkus Reviews_ ) Product Description Tragic tale of a retarded man and the friend who loves and tries to protect him. With illustrations from the movie starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd4bb48685135a1f6e41.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":0,"goodreads_ratings":0,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e14fb486852b17db5c50","5c29e14fb486852b17db5c51","5c29e14fb486852b17db5c52","5c29e14fb486852b17db5c53","5c29e14fb486852b17db5c54","5c29e14fb486852b17db5c55"],"year":"1993","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"鼠与人"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[0],"goodreads_ratings":[0],"year":["1993"],"zh_bookname":["鼠与人"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["Of Mice and Men"]}}

Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist of Steinbeck s last novel, works as a clerk in a grocery store that his family once owned. With Ethan no longer a member of Long Island s aristocratic class, his wife is restless, and his teenage children are hungry for the tantalizing material comforts he cannot provide. Then one day, in a moment of moral crisis, Ethan decides to take a holiday from his own scrupulous standards. Set in Steinbeck s contemporary 1960 America, the novel explores the tenuous line between private and public honesty, and today ranks alongside his most acclaimed works of penetrating insight into the American condition.

With the inquisitiveness of an investigative reporter and the emotional power of a novelist in his prime, Steinbeck toured the squatters' camps and Hoovervilles of California. Here he found once strong, independent farmers—the backbone of rural America—so reduced in dignity, beaten in spirit, sick, sullen, and defeated that they had been \"cast down to a kind of subhumanity.\" He contrasts their misery with the hope offered by government resettlement camps, where self-help committees, child nurseries, quilting and sewing projects, and decent sanitation were restoring dignity and indeed saving lives. _The Harvest Gypsies_ gives us an eyewitness account of the horrendous Dust Bowl migration, a major event in California history, and provides the factual foundation for Steinbeck's masterpiece, _The Grapes of Wrath_. Included are twenty-two photographs by Dorothea Lange and others, many of which accompanied Steinbeck's original articles.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62e4e7b4868513b9aa5be7.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.83,"goodreads_ratings":616,"level":9,"publisher":"Heyday Books","segments":["5c29eda5b486852f6a6750d6","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750d7","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750d8","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750d9","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750da","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750db","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750dc","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750dd","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750de","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750df","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e0","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e1","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e2","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e3","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e4","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e5","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e6","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e7","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e8","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750e9","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750ea","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750eb","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750ec","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750ed","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750ee","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750ef","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750f0","5c29eda5b486852f6a6750f1"],"year":"2002","zh_author":"约翰 斯坦贝克","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"收获吉普赛人：愤怒之葡萄之路"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.83],"goodreads_ratings":[616],"year":["2002"],"zh_bookname":["收获吉普赛人：愤怒之葡萄之路"],"author":["John Steinbeck"],"zh_author":["约翰 斯坦贝克"],"bookname":["The Harvest Gypsies: On the Road to the Grapes of Wrath"]}}

Taken away to sober up in jail, all that night he is gripped by hallucinations: the impoverished hermit believes he has become a healer, walking from village to village, tending to the sick, waiting for a sign from God. In this dream, his one companion, Moustique, wants to exploit his power. Moustique decides to impersonate a prophet himself, ignoring a coffin-maker who warns him he will die and enraging the people of the island. Hobain, half-awake in his desolate jail cell, terrorized by the specter of his friend's corruption, clings to his visionary quest. He will try to transform himself; to heal Moustique, his jailer, and his jail-mates; and to be a leader for his people. Dream on Monkey Mountain was awarded the 1971 Obie Award for a Distinguished Foreign Play when it was first presented in New York, and Edith Oliver, writing in The New Yorker , called it \"a masterpiece.\" Three of Derek's Walcott's most popular short plays are also included in this volume: Ti-Jean and His Brothers ; Malcochon, or The Six in the Rain ; and The Sea at Dauphin . In an expansive introductory essay, \"What the Twilight Says,\" the playwright explains his founding of the seminal dramatic company where these works were first performed, the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. First published in 1970, Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays is an essential part of Walcott's vast and important body of work.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dddab48685135a229ac3.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.6,"goodreads_ratings":320,"level":3,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b4","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b5","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b6","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b7","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b8","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0b9","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0ba","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0bb","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0bc","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0bd","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0be","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0bf","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c0","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c1","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c2","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c3","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c4","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c5","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c6","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c7","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c8","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0c9","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0ca","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0cb","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0cc","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0cd","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0ce","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0cf","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d0","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d1","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d2","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d3","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d4","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d5","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d6","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d7","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d8","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0d9","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0da","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0db","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0dc","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0dd","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0de","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0df","5c29e6fcb486852b17dde0e0"],"year":"2014","zh_author":"德里克 沃尔科特","zh_author_from":"dbpedia","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"梦见猴山及其他戏剧"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.6],"goodreads_ratings":[320],"year":["2014"],"zh_bookname":["梦见猴山及其他戏剧"],"author":["Derek Walcott"],"zh_author":["德里克 沃尔科特"],"bookname":["Dream on Monkey Mountain & Other Plays"]}}

The setting is Alexandria, Mississippi, where one Mother's Day a little boy named Robin Cleve Dufresnes was found hanging from a tree in his parents' yard. Twelve years later Robin's murder is still unsolved and his family remains devastated. So it is that Robin's sister Harriet--unnervingly bright, insufferably determined, and unduly influenced by the fiction of Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson--sets out to unmask his killer. Aided only by her worshipful friend Hely, Harriet crosses her town's rigid lines of race and caste and burrows deep into her family's history of loss. Filled with hairpin turns of plot and \"a bustling, ridiculous humanity worthy of Dickens\" ( The New York Times Book Review ), The Little Friend is a work of myriad enchantments by a writer of prodigious talent.

Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality their lives are changed profoundly and forever, and they discover how hard it can be to truly live and how easy it is to kill. An impressive debut novel from a new voice in fiction, The Secret History tells of a small circle of friends at an esteemed college in New England, whose studies in Classical Greek lead them to odd rituals, shocking behavior--and murder.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62de45b48685135a252cd9.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":4.08,"goodreads_ratings":216739,"level":2,"publisher":"","segments":["5c29ebacb486852b17dfddb9","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddba","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddbb","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddbc","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddbd","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddbe","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddbf","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc0","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc1","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc2","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc3","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc4","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc5","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc6","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc7","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc8","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddc9","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddca","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddcb","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddcc","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddcd","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddce","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddcf","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd0","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd1","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd2","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd3","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd4","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd5","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd6","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd7","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd8","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddd9","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddda","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdddb","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdddc","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdddd","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddde","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdddf","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde0","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde1","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde2","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde3","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde4","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde5","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde6","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde7","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde8","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdde9","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddea","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddeb","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddec","5c29ebacb486852b17dfdded","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddee","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddef","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf0","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf1","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf2","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf3","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf4","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf5","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf6","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf7","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf8","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddf9","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddfa","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddfb","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddfc","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddfd","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddfe","5c29ebacb486852b17dfddff","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde00","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde01","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde02","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde03","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde04","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde05","5c29ebacb486852b17dfde06"],"year":"1992","zh_author":"唐娜 塔特","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"秘史"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[4.08],"goodreads_ratings":[216739],"year":["1992"],"zh_bookname":["秘史"],"author":["Donna Tartt"],"zh_author":["唐娜 塔特"],"bookname":["The Secret History"]}}

Jim, a sleek, successful corporate lawyer, has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives, and Bob, a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim, has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister, Susan - the Burgess sibling who stayed behind - urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son, Zach, has gotten himself into a world of trouble, and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood, where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever. With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling, exquisite prose, and remarkable insight into character, Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page. Tender, tough-minded, loving, and deeply illuminating about the ties that bind us to family and home, The Burgess Boys is Elizabeth Strouts newest and perhaps most astonishing work of literary art.","comments":[],"copyright":true,"cover":"http://202.120.38.146:8688/covers/5b62dd6eb48685135a200d8e.jpg","goodreads_ratingVal":3.56,"goodreads_ratings":49415,"level":2,"publisher":"Random House","segments":["5c29e268b486852b17dbdb2e","5c29e268b486852b17dbdb2f","5c29e268b486852b17dbdb30","5c29e268b486852b17dbdb31"],"year":"2013","zh_author":"伊丽莎白 斯特劳特","zh_author_from":"original","zh_book_from":"original","zh_bookname":"伯吉斯男孩"},"fields":{"goodreads_ratingVal":[3.56],"goodreads_ratings":[49415],"year":["2013"],"zh_bookname":["伯吉斯男孩"],"author":["Elizabeth Strout"],"zh_author":["伊丽莎白 斯特劳特"],"bookname":["The Burgess Boys"]}}

Now in her dazzling new novel, People of the Book, Brooks allows both her native land and current events to play a larger role while still continuing to mine the historical material that speaks so ardently to her imagination. Late one night in the city of Sydney, Hanna Heath, a rare book conservator, gets a phone call. The Sarajevo Haggadah, which disappeared during the siege in 1992, has been found, and Hanna has been invited by the U.N. to report on its condition. Missing documents and art works (as Dan Brown and Lev Grossman, among others, have demonstrated) are endlessly appealing, and from this inviting premise Brooks spins her story in two directions. In the present, we follow the resolutely independent Hanna through her thrilling first encounter with the beautifully illustrated codex and her discovery of the tiny signs-a white hair, an insect wing, missing clasps, a drop of salt, a wine stain-that will help her to discover its provenance. Along with the book she also meets its savior, a Muslim librarian named Karaman. Their romance offers both predictable pleasures and genuine surprises, as does the other main relationship in Hanna's life: her fraught connection with her mother. In the other strand of the narrative we learn, moving backward through time, how the codex came to be lost and found, and made. From the opening section, set in Sarajevo in 1940, to the final section, set in Seville in 1480, these narratives show Brooks writing at her very best. With equal authority she depicts the struggles of a young girl to escape the Nazis, a duel of wits between an inquisitor and a rabbi living in the Venice ghetto, and a girl's passionate relationship with her mistress in a harem. Like the illustrations in the Haggadah, each of these sections transports the reader to a fully realized, vividly peopled world. And each gives a glimpse of both the long history of anti-Semitism and of the struggle of women toward the independence that Hanna, despite her mother's lectures, tends to take for granted. Brooks is too good a novelist to belabor her political messages, but her depiction of the Haggadah bringing together Jews, Christians and Muslims could not be more timely. Her gift for storytelling, happily, is timeless.

This angry, destructive ghost breaks mirrors, leaves its fingerprints in cake icing, and generally makes life difficult for Sethe and her family; nevertheless, the woman finds the haunting oddly comforting for the spirit is that of her own dead baby, never named, thought of only as Beloved. A dead child, a runaway slave, a terrible secret--these are the central concerns of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning Beloved . Morrison, a Nobel laureate, has written many fine novels, including Song of Solomon , The Bluest Eye , and Paradise --but Beloved is arguably her best. To modern readers, antebellum slavery is a subject so familiar that it is almost impossible to render its horrors in a way that seems neither clich d nor melodramatic. Rapes, beatings, murders, and mutilations are recounted here, but they belong to characters so precisely drawn that the tragedy remains individual , terrifying to us because it is terrifying to the sufferer. And Morrison is master of the telling detail: in the bit , for example, a punishing piece of headgear used to discipline recalcitrant slaves, she manages to encapsulate all of slavery's many cruelties into one apt symbol--a device that deprives its wearer of speech. \"Days after it was taken out, goose fat was rubbed on the corners of the mouth but nothing to soothe the tongue or take the wildness out of the eye.\" Most importantly, the language here, while often lyrical, is never overheated. Even as she recalls the cruelties visited upon her while a slave, Sethe is evocative without being overemotional: \"Add my husband to it, watching, above me in the loft--hiding close by--the one place he thought no one would look for him, looking down on what I couldn't look at at all. And not stopping them--looking and letting it happen.... And if he was that broken then, then he is also and certainly dead now.\" Even the supernatural is treated as an ordinary fact of life: \"Not a house in the country ain't packed to its rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky this ghost is a baby,\" comments Sethe's mother-in-law. Beloved is a dense, complex novel that yields up its secrets one by one. As Morrison takes us deeper into Sethe's history and her memories, the horrifying circumstances of her baby's death start to make terrible sense. And as past meets present in the shape of a mysterious young woman about the same age as Sethe's daughter would have been, the narrative builds inexorably to its powerful, painful conclusion. Beloved may well be the defining novel of slavery in America, the one that all others will be measured by. --Alix Wilber From Publishers Weekly Mixed with the lyric beauty of the writing, the fury in Morrison's (Song of Solomonp latest book is almost palpable. Set in rural Ohio several years after the Civil War, this haunting chronicle of slavery and its aftermath traces the life of a young woman, Sethe, who has kept a terrible memory at bay only by shutting down part of her mind. Juxtaposed with searing descriptions of brutality, gradually revealed in flashbacks, are equally harrowing scenes in which fantasy takes flesh, a device Morrison handles with consummate skill. The narrative concerns Sethe's former life as a slave on Sweet Home Farm, her escape with her children to what seems a safe haven and the tragic events that ensue. The death of Sethe's infant daughter Beloved is the incident on which the plot hinges, and it is obvious to the reader that the sensuous young woman who mysteriously appears one day is Beloved's spirit, come back to claim Sethe's love. Sethe's surviving daughter, Denver, immediately grasps the significance of Beloved's return and so does Paul Dno period after D, another escapee from Sweet Home; but Sethe herself resists comprehension, and, as a result, a certain loss of tension affects the latter part of the narrative. But this is a small flaw in a novel full of insights, both piercing and tender, with distinctive, memorable characters, flowing prose that conveys speech patterns with musical intensity and a brilliantly conceived story. As a record of white brutality mitigated by rare acts of decency and compassion, and as a testament to the courageous lives of a tormented people, this novel is a milestone in the chronicling of the black experience in America. It is Morrison writing at the height of her considerable powers, and it should not be missed. BOMC main selection.
